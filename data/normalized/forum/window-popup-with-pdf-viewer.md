# Window PopUp With PDF Viewer

## Question

**Mic** asked on 30 May 2024

Hi, I'm using a Data Grid where I have a button list of documents, I have a button to pop open a window with the PDF viewer, there is a slight delay, and I was wondering if possible, to have a loading screen when click then when Window pop open it stops loading...

Hi Michael, For such scenarios, we provide the following components that allow you to show them during a delay or longer task: TelerikLoaderContainer - designed to cover a whole component, HTML element, or the whole page. TelerikLoader - more suitable for showing a loading indicator in a smaller area of the page and without an overlay. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
