# Grid doesn't enter in EditMode

## Question

**Cip** asked on 17 Jan 2023

Hello, I have a grid where is use OnRead to get the data. The EditMode is set to Inline. I can insert, and delete a row from the grid but I can't edit a row. I have defined EditorTemplate but it doesn't enter into it. I'm trying to migrate the solution on the version 3.7.0 of your framework. Previously I had the version 2.29 of your framework where I didn't got that problem. Behind the grid I have a DataTable like in this example: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/data-table](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/data-table) I've read the articles regarding this issue and I also tried the solution on this topic [https://www.telerik.com/forums/grid-with-inline-edit-how-to-add-new-row-and-manage-save-cancel-request-from-code](https://www.telerik.com/forums/grid-with-inline-edit-how-to-add-new-row-and-manage-save-cancel-request-from-code) But it doesn't seams to work for me, the EditorTemplate is not displayed. I will appreciate if you can help me on this issue. Thank you in advance, Cipri
