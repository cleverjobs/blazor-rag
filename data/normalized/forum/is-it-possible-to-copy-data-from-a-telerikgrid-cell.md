Hello Peter, In general, it is possible to Copy the Data from the Grid cells. Based on the attached screenshot, I assume that the behavior you are encountering is related to a bug in the Grid Cell Selection in version 6.1.0. The issue has already been resolved in our latest version 6.2.0. To benefit from that fix, I recommend upgrading to our latest version. Please excuse us for the trouble caused. If my assumption that you're using version 6.1.0 is incorrect, please confirm the version you're using. Additionally, provide an example via our REPL platform that reproduces the issue. This will help me to see the behavior first-hand and troubleshoot it further. I look forward to your reply. Regards, Tsvetomir Progress Telerik

Tsvetomir, I am very new to web development. Suppose you release another Update in October that fixes a bug. Suppose my app is published on Azure. Will updating my app with the latest Telerik Package cause a temporary interruption to the operation of my Azure app? Or is it possible to update the Package without interrupting my Azure App? Thank you.

Hello Peter, Thank you for coming back with feedback. I'm glad to hear that the issue is resolved. I'm not aware for an issues related to the Azure after completion of an update. If you encounter such a scenario, I can recommend contacting the Microsoft support, because the Telerik UI for Blazor library has no connection with the Azure deployment process. Also, those type of questions are out of our support services scope. I hope you find well the provided information. Regards, Tsvetomir
