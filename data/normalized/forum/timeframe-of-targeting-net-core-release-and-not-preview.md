# Timeframe of targeting .net core release and not preview?

## Question

**Bit** asked on 30 Oct 2019

I suppose at some point the UI for Blazor library will only target release versions of .net core rather than preview releases?

Hi, The way the framework evolves will determine that. Perhaps after the WASM flavor becomes official it will be possible to slow down and work on compatibility with RTM releases only. At the moment, this is not possible. Our next release will have an article in the documentation that will list the supported framework versions so you can use it as a reference.
