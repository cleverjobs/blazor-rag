Hello Nazim, Thank you for the provided information and screenshots about the scenario you are facing. To change the format of the CheckBoxList dates of the FilterMenu sounds like a good idea for a feature request. Thus, I submitted it on your behalf on our Public Feedback Portal: Add the ability to change the DateTime format in a CheckBoxList FilterMenu. You are automatically subscribed as a creator to receive email notifications for status updates. For the time being, the desired outcome can be achieved by customizing the FilterMenu with a Filter Menu Template. Regards, Tsvetomir Progress Telerik
