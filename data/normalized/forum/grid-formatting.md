Just a quick formatting question! Whenever I create a grid, I always get a small column on the right side. How do I remove that?

Hi Andy, This looks like it may be caused by an old theme or some custom CSS, possibly when trying to remove the vertical scroll bar. Please try the solution in our How to Remove the Vertical Grid Scrollbar article and see if this fixes the issue. Regards, Justin
