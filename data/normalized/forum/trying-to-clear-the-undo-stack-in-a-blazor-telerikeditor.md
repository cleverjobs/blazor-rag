# Trying to clear the Undo stack in a Blazor TelerikEditor

## Question

**Rol** asked on 20 Sep 2021

I bind the TelerikEditor Value to a property that is reloaded with different unrelated content. The editor keeps the Undo/Redo stack so for the "second" content I can Undo back to the "first" content. How do I clear the Undo stack when the bound property is changed?
