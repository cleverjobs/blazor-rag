## Question

**Kis** asked on 20 Dec 2021

Hello, We are using TelericBlazor Grid with Drag and Drop functionality, as per link [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/drag-drop](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/drag-drop) Now, I am dragging the items from one grid to another Grid., like dragging ITEMA from GRID-A to GRID-B, which is working as expected. But as a User, I want to change the background color of the dragged ITEMA to Different color. So Is there any way to change the style of the dragged and dropped row in the Telerik grid?
