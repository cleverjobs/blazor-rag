In GridPagerSettings we can configure if show pages as Button OR with an input box. In Angular version of Telerik UI il allowed to show pages as Button AND with an input box. Who to allow this in Blazor UI? Thanks

Hi Claudio, I confirm that having two pagers with different input types is entirely achievable in Blazor. You can accomplish this by using our standalone TelerikPager component, which can be easily integrated into the Grid's toolbar. In order to provide a practical example of this approach, I've prepared a demonstration within this REPL link for you. Please run and test it to determine if the result meets your specific requirements. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik

this solution is a bit ugly as user interface, in Angular version of Telerik UI this task is handled in the bottom pager. It would be glad to reply the behaviour of Telerik UI for Angular, implementing a grid property.

Hi Claudio, Could you share the Angular Grid configuration you are using for comparison? That will serve me as a reference. I look forward to hearing from you. Kind Regards, Hristian
