# Drag & Drop Events

## Question

**Gra** asked on 04 Mar 2020

Hi, I don't see listed any support to have drop events on the scheduler. I have a requirement where I have a list of things (lets say tasks) and they need to be allocated to days. I did create a day list component but thought a week view calendar maybe a better end user experience. Can I have a list of things on the right and be able to drop them onto the calendar at a specific date and get the relevant task attributes so that I can update the record in the persistence layer to assign that task to the date? Even just a simple demo to point me in the right direction would be handy. If this is not possible I will continue on my own component that uses a list and the user "selects" the active day and marks items in the grid and clicks an "add" button to assign those tasks to the selected day.

very similar to how it happens in your asp.net ajax demo we would also require this feature to drag from a grid or tree into a schedule we have hundreds of predefined tasks that are filtered and then posted to scheduling grids for maintenance records or for personal or team calendars
