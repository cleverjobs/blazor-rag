# Anyway to delay display when show on Hover?

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 04 Dec 2020

Is there anyway to delay the showing of the toolip when showing on hover? I want it to only show the toolip tip if I hover over an item for more than some time period (i.e. 3 seconds)

Hi Bob, I see how this could be useful in some situations, so I created a Feature Request and added your vote for it. You can also follow the feature request here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1498546-delay-display-when-show](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1498546-delay-display-when-show) I cannot give you an easy workaround for now, but it will be achievable with some custom code after we add a method for programmatically showing the tooltip.
