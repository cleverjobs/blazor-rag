Hi Eric, If the installation was successful, the msi should have provided the Visual Studio extension for Telerik UI for Blazor. You may check if the extension was added - Extensions>Manage Extensions>Installed: If you see the extension in this list but it's missing in the menu, you might want to close and reopen Visual Studio, so the changes may take place. If this does not help, you may additionally get the extension: From the Visual Studio marketplace for Windows: Visual Studio 2022 for Windows Visual Studio 2019 for Windows From your Telerik.com account - the .mpack file for VS for Mac. I hope you will find the above information useful to move forward. Please let us know if you are facing any other difficulties. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva Progress Telerik
