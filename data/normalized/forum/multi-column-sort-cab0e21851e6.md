# Multi-column sort?

## Question

**Kel** asked on 02 Apr 2020

Hi, Our company is evaluating Telerik's Blazor grid for our project, and it's looking like Telerik has just about all the features we need. One thing we would very much like is multi-column sort, but I didn't see that as an option currently. Is multi-column sorting something that is available but not documented? Or is it on the roadmap? If it's on the roadmap, that would be awesome.

Hi Kelly, Thank you for your interest in Telerik controls for Blazor. We are truly proud to provide probably the most advanced toolset in the world for this new technology. And not only currently, look at what's coming up in R2 and R3 and how many more grid improvements there will be soon: [https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/roadmap](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/roadmap) We recently implemented a similar feature: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1408645-ability-to-set-sortable-for-individual-columns](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1408645-ability-to-set-sortable-for-individual-columns) And now it is possible to sort the grid on individual column basis: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/sorting](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/sorting) Multi-column sorting has its own different feedback item in the portal, which is also high in demand: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1411730-multi-column-sorting](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1411730-multi-column-sorting) I have added your Vote for this item to raise its priority and you can click the Follow button to get status change notifications.
