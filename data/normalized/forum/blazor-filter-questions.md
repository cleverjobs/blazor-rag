# Blazor filter questions

## Question

**Cir** asked on 10 Apr 2024

Hi, I'm thinking of purchasing Telerik for the Blazor Filter control. Can you confirm if the following are possible... 1/ Can the filter fields be grouped into categories in the drop down, eg using demo sample field drop down looks like this Id Quantity Freight Country Ship to Ship Address but are grouped items possible? Group-1 -Id -Quantity -Freight Group-2 -Country -Ship to -Ship Address 2/ Can filter rules be re-ordered using drag and drop. Eg re-order rule1, rule2, rule3 as rule3, rule1, rule2 without having to delete and re-create? 3/ Can templates be applied to each row to add extra logic, eg Field Operator Value Disable Rule (additional checkbox) Additional Data (additional form with multiple controls) Thanks, C

Hi Cirrus, 3 will be possible when we release the Filter ValueTemplate in May 2024. The other two features are not supported, I am afraid.
