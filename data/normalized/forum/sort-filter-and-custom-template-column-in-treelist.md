# Sort, Filter and custom template column in TreeList

## Question

**Tua** asked on 17 Mar 2022

I am using TreeList and a custom template on a column to display user avatar. I also need to sort and filter on this column. However when combine all of these features (sort and filter) on a template column, it doesn't work. There are 2 scenarios: - When enable sort, the filtering works - When disable sort, the filtering doesnt work Is there any work around solution for this? I am using U I for Blazor 3.0.1 My snippet [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/mQuxlWkD32B5eGay33](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/mQuxlWkD32B5eGay33)

Hello Tuan, Thank you for reporting and for providing a REPL snippet to easily test this. I can indeed confirm this is unexpected behavior, which I already logged on to our public thread on your behalf. Here is a link to the bug report: Filter menu icon missing in an unsortable column in a sortable TreeList. You are automatically subscribed to receive updates of when its status changes. Thank you again for reporting. Regards, Radko Stanev Progress Telerik
