# Telerik UI for Blazor TextBox Format - Prevent Default Button

## Question

**Ric** asked on 02 Apr 2023

For the Telerik UI For Blazor, I need to prevent the button from refreshing the page and for a textbox I need to format it as a phone number. I could not find answers to this in the documentation or searching the internet. It keeps referring me back to Kendo UI. How can I achieve this?
