## Question

**Fed** asked on 22 Apr 2025

By default, the `ContextMenu` opens a `List` of medium size. Can you add a way to customise it?

You're right â€” the ContextMenu component currently doesn't support a Size parameter. I've submitted a feature request for this here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1685493-add-support-for-size-parameter-in-contextmenu-component.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1685493-add-support-for-size-parameter-in-contextmenu-component.) Feel free to upvote it so you can get notified about any updates, like when the request is reviewed. Regards, Anislav Atanasov
