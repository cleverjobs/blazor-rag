Hello Wajdi, You can also Follow this feature's implementation that will provide such an ability from the grid's side: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1441291-ability-to-enable-disable-checkbox-in-checkbox-column-to-allow-prevent-selection-of-the-row.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1441291-ability-to-enable-disable-checkbox-in-checkbox-column-to-allow-prevent-selection-of-the-row.) The thread offers three ideas you could use right now. I've also added your Vote to it on your behalf to raise its priority.
