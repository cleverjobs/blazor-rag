# Merge column charts using different axes

## Question

**Dat** asked on 04 Dec 2020

Is it possible to have 2 different column values show for each chart category? 1 data series would show wider than the other data series and they would be together for each vertical section? Essentially a multi-axis column chart but merged together for matching categories.
