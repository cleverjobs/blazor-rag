# Pager UI Customization

## Question

**Nic** asked on 11 Dec 2019

Hi (Marin)! I have some questions/suggestions around the pager part of the grid: It would be nice if we could specify whether to show the page numbers at all and if so, how many. This can become an issue particularly on mobile browsers. On mobile browsers the pager part of the grid has a few issues. Firstly the end of the pager is cut off and the numbers etc don't flow. Secondly the "1 - 50 of 130 items" text does flow across multiple lines and causes the height of the pager to increase which takes up a lot of the mobile screen. I think ideally the number of page selectors (the "1", "2", "3" page numbers in boxes) would reduce to the point they disappear completely as the screen width decreases, leaving just the next/previous, first/last arrows, to reduce the amount of space the pager takes up. And the "1-50 of 130 items" would maybe be hidden completely. I realise I can probably adjust this using CSS myself, but it would be nice to have some better default behaviour! I've attached some screen shots (simulated on desktop) to illustrate the issue Thanks, Nick
