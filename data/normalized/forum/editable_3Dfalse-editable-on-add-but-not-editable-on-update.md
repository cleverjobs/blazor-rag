# Editable=false, Editable on Add, but not editable on Update

## Question

**Joh** asked on 04 Nov 2020

Hi, I cannot find examples, docs, etc. on the case when you'd like a column to only be editable on add, but not on update. So far I've played with a custom editor template, but cannot find a way to achieve the desired behavior. Thanks!
