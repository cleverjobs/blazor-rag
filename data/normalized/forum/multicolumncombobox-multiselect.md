Hi Eric, Yes, the MultiColumnComboBox is designed for a single value. Multiple selection will require a separate "MultiColumnMultiSelect" component that is not on our roadmap, but may come to existence in the more distant future. Currently you can use the MultiColumnComboBox for adding items to a separate collection that is rendered with a ListView. Another option would be the future ChipList component that we intend to develop (we will reopen this ChipList feature request for status tracking). Regards, Dimo
