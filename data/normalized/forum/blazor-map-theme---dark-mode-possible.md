# Blazor Map Theme - Dark Mode Possible?

## Question

**Mic** asked on 25 May 2023

I am using the tiles from openstreetmap and would like to apply a dark mode theme to the Blazor Map component. There is mention of using the Sass Theme Builder on the overview page, but the Map is not one of the components listed. Is this possible? Thanks for any help on this topic.

Hello Michael, The Map itself supports dark mode and you can verify this on our online demos. There is no need to list the Map in the ThemeBuilder, as it only uses a few buttons and its appearance depends on button styles. However, the map tiles may not support dark mode, unless you find a tile provider that serves dark tile images. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
