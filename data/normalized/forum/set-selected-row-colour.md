# Set selected row colour

## Question

**RobRob** asked on 23 Jan 2023

Hi, I'm struggling to find a simple way to set the selected row colour. I'm using the bootstrap theme. I want to change it to the indigo/tertiary colour in the bootstrap theme but I'm getting nowhere. It's still a light blue. Can you assist please. Many thanks, Rob

Ok I've managed to get a bit further by adding the following to my app.css: .k-grid.k-selected.k-table-td { background-color: #6f42c1!important; color: #ffffff!important;
} This seems to do the trick. Are there any obvious issues with this method? Many thanks, Rob

Hello Rob, I'm glad to hear that you've managed to find a solution. Thank you for sharing it with the community. In general, it is a good practice to avoid using the "!important" statement. With that being said, I can suggest using a bit different CSS selector with higher specificity. <style>.k-table-tbody.k-table-row.k-selected>.k-table-td { background-color: #6f42c1; color: #ffffff;
}
</style> Thus the "!important" statement is no longer needed. Here is an example: [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wdEvGAaV43zOzxdB15](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wdEvGAaV43zOzxdB15) –êlso note that the CSS above will affect all the Grids in the current page. If you want to affect only a specific Grid you can apply a custom Class and use it in the CSS rule. <TelerikGrid Class="my-grid" I hope this helps.

Many thanks Yanislav, Yes I wanted to change all grids to behave the same. I used your example; the only thing I had to do was to add .k-grid to the beginning to get the desired effect. Many thanks for you help and advice. Rob .k-grid.k-table-tbody.k-table-row.k-selected>.k-table-td { background-color: #6f42c1; color: #ffffff;
}
