Hello Ivan, The following documentation article provides additional details on how to configure the localization: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization) In short, you can open the "TelerikMessages.resx" file and edit the "Grid_SelectAllRows" entry for the "Select all rows" string and "Grid_SelectRow" for the "Select a row" string.
