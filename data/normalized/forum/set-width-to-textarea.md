# Set Width to TextArea

## Question

**Kev** asked on 13 Nov 2020

Since Width is not an option for TextArea, is there anyway to change the size of the TextArea? E.g. set it to 80% of the available div length etc? thanks Kevin

Hello Kevin, We have an open Feature Request on our Feedback Portal for the addition of a Width parameter to the TextArea, which you could see from this link. I have added your vote for it and you can Follow it for email notifications on status updates. In the public thread, I have offered a solution for the time being. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
