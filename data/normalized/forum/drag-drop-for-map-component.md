# Drag&Drop for Map component

## Question

**Ale** asked on 14 Jun 2024

Hi Team, would it be possible to add Drag and Drop to the Map component? We have already a lot of items in our application that we want to place on the map and it would be way easier if we could just drag them from a grid or listview onto the map and then save the retreived coordinates in the items and add them to the marker layers data. Thank you very much in advance! Best regards, Alexander Schneider

Hi Alexander, I must admit that the Map doesn't support drag and drop at at this point. We have a feature request to change Marker position on user interaction Please review the request and post your own message if you want to describe a different related use case. In the meantime, consider a workaround that is based on Map click events instead. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
