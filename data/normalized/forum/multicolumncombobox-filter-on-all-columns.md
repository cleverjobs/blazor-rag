# MultiColumnComboBox Filter on All columns

## Question

**Eri** asked on 03 May 2024

Is there a way to allow the filtering logic for the MultiColumnComboBox to search across all visible columns? or even just all columns?

Hi Eric, We have an open feature request that will enable you to filter by multiple fields simultaneously: Filter by multiple fields in the MultiColumnComboBox textbox. I've voted on your behalf and raised its priority. If you wish to stay updated on its progress, you can also subscribe to receive email notifications for status updates. Currently, the MultiColumnComboBox component supports filtering by a single field only. Rest assured, if an alternative solution becomes available in the interim, I will promptly add it as a comment in the provided link. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik

I'll keep an eye on that feature request. Is there a property to set which field it searches again or is it always the TextField?

Hi Eric, I confirm that, currently, the filter uses the TextField only. Kind Regards, Hristian
