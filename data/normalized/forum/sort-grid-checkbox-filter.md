Hi Aleksandr, Sorting capability would be implemented in this enhancement: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1504816-sorted-checkboxlistfilter-by-default.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1504816-sorted-checkboxlistfilter-by-default.) I've added your Vote, and to know when it becomes available, click the Follow button. The menu template option is the current way to implement such sorting, and it is likely that it will remain the approach if ascending sort is not what you seek.
