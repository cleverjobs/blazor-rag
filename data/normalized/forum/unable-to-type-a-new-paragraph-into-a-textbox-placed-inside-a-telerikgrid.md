# Unable to type a new paragraph into a textbox placed inside a TelerikGrid

## Question

**Joh** asked on 09 Sep 2021

As it stands at the moment, what I'm assuming are the grid keyboard settings means that shift-enter doesn't add a newline when typing text, it instead confirms the edit and saves the grid row. Is there a way around this? All the best, John
