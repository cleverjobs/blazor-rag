# How can we get a button to have the same styling as the Bootstrap 'btn-danger' button?

## Question

**Dav** asked on 13 Dec 2021

I can't find a 'k' class to make my TelerikButton look like the Bootstrap "danger" button. And if I use 'btn btn-danger' for the Class property of my TelerikButton that doesnt work either. Is there a "k" class to do this or do I need to clear out the built in TelerikButton style somehow and write my own?

Hello David, I am happy to report that as part of our 3.0.0 release we will introduce a number of customization options for all Buttons (TelerikButton, CommandButton, ToggleButton, etc.) in the Telerik UI for Blazor. One of those options would be to determine different color styles for the button. You can currently preview them from the Loader Appearance article, the ThemeColor section. The same theme colors will be exposed to the buttons. Can you preview them and determine if those theme color options would be sufficient for your application? Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
