# Within a Tile, if the child control is taller than the tile's height, no scrollbars appear

## Question

**Doo** asked on 26 Jul 2021

Hi! I have a Grid inside a Tile. Sometimes, the rows increase making the Grid taller than that Tile's height. There is no visual cue when that happens. How to get scrollbars to appear in this case? The Grid doesn't sense the limitation of parent's (Tile) height and keeps increasing its heigh without showing scroll bars. In case of over-sized content, Tile should show scroll bars.

Hi Hassan, Please review the TileLayout Tile Content ScrollBars section of the documentation for more details on why there are no scrollbars by default, how to generally set the content, and how to enable scrollbars if you want them. Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
