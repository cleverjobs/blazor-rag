# Grid: SelectedItemsChanged not firing when in EditMode

## Question

**Hen** asked on 11 Aug 2022

Long story short: The SelectedItemsChanged-Event is not firing when the Grid is in EditMode like "GridEditMode.Incell". When the EditMode is "GridEditMode.None" it works just fine. Is this a bug or a feature ?

@Hendrik - if we should think in these terms, then that would be a documented "feature":)

Hello Dimo, thanks for the answer. I tried to read all the documentation about this subject but I must have missed it. I am new to Blazor and have to realize that things are a little bit different in this world.
