## Question

**Mic** asked on 06 Sep 2021

Hello, Is there a way to automatically display total row count on the bottom of a TelerikGrid ? Please note data source is an IQuerayble and Gridscroll mode is Virtual. I want to show total row count, with filter consideration. By the way, is it possible to display sum or average of each column ? Thanks

Hello Mickael, Have you had a chance to try the aggregates and footers: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/templates/column-footer?](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/templates/column-footer?) They do work with virtual scrolling. Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
