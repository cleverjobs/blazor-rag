# Hide column for display but show when editing

## Question

**Dav** asked on 10 Nov 2020

Hi there, We were wondering if it is currently possible to hide a column (Visible=false) but still show it when the user edits the row. We would not like to show all the columns in the grid but still allow the user to edit some of them. Currently, when GridColumn.Visible is set to false, the field will not show up in the edit dialog. Kind regards, Davin

I just work out by setting the GridColumn Width="0px" seems to do that.
