# Orgchart functionality, jquery, asp.net

## Question

**Sam** asked on 05 Jul 2023

I need an org chart functionality, but telerik doesn't have an org chart component for Blazor. I'm considering integrate asp org chart component o jQuery org char component, and this is my question, what approach is better? If found this: [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/kendo-in-blazor](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/kendo-in-blazor)

Use the jQuery widget. ASP.NET MVC/Core components cannot be used in Blazor.
