# Migrate from ASP.NET Webforms to Blazer

## Question

**Mic** asked on 01 Mar 2023

I have an extensive app in webforms using Telerik controls. Do Telerik controls for Blazor function similar to Telerik coontrols for ASP.NET Forms? I'm trying to understand the scope of work to migrate to Blazor. My app has little Javascript and mostly code behind forms.

Hi Michael, If you are migrating from Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, then you can have a look at the Blazor Server-side hosting model, which works in a way that is closer to ASP.NET WebForms compared to the other alternative- Blazor WebAssembly. Can you check the above links and inform me if you need further assistance? Regards, Stamo Gochev Progress Telerik
