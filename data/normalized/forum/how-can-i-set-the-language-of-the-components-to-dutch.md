# How can I set the language of the components to Dutch?

## Question

**And** asked on 23 Jul 2023

I tried several suggestions, but I don't succeed in this task. I don't need a multi-lingual approach, just simple dutch labels and datetime formatting.

Hi Andre, As a start, I recommend going through this resource: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization.) It provides a detailed explanation of how the localization works in the Telerik components for Blazor and how you can enable it in your app. If you do not need a multi-lingual approach, you can just use the Dutch CultureInfo in your application. The messages(labels) are stored in .resx files and each language has a dedicated file. To include Dutch for the components you must add a .resx that contains the needed messages in Dutch. Dutch is not part of our officially supported translations but you can create the transitions yourself. We have a community-driven public repo with messages where you can also commit yours: [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui-messages/tree/main/Messages.](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui-messages/tree/main/Messages.) As for the date formatting, the components use the culture of the current thread to render the appropriate culture-specific format for dates, numbers, and currency. You may find more details here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/globalization-formats.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/globalization-formats.) Having this in mind, if the application culture is Dutch, the components in it should show the according formatting. Please let us know if you experience different behavior.
