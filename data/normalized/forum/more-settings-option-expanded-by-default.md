Is it possible to have the "More settings" option in the print screen expanded by default? I have a requirement that the "More settings" options be expanded by default.

Hi Akilesh, As per my research on the topic, setting the "More settings" option expanded by default and customizing the browser's print dialog window isn't directly possible through HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The appearance and behavior of the print dialog are controlled by the user's browser and operating system settings, and they're typically not customizable by web developers. Our TelerikPDFViewer component uses the default browser printing engine, but the browser's print dialog window is not part of the component itself. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
