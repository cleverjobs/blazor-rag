# Filter numeric columns for empty or non-empty values

## Question

**Ray** asked on 19 May 2023

Hi, Within the Grid I use a custom filter row as it is shown at [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/custom-filter-row](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/custom-filter-row) Is there any way to filter a numeric column for lines with or without a value given? Normally this is available for string types. Best regards, Rayko

Hello Rayko, The "Units On Order" column has a filter operator list that includes "Is null/is not null" filters, so I suppose this is what you mean by "way to filter a numeric column for lines with or without a value given". If this is not the case, can you send me runnable Telerik Blazor REPL example that demonstrates your scenario as well as provide more details on what you want to achieve.

Hi Stamo, I wasn't aware of the Is Null/Not Null option. That was it! Thank you! Best regards, Rayko
