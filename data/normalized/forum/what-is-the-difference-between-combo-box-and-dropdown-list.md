I checked demos for both for Blazor, but the functionality seems to be identical. Can someone explain the differences? Thanks!

Hi Satish, Perhaps the main difference is the UX - the combo box has an input in the main element where you can immediately type, and it shows text. The drodownlist has its filter in the dropdown so it requires more clicks to get in there, but the main element has a template and can show more than text. Regards, Marin Bratanov
