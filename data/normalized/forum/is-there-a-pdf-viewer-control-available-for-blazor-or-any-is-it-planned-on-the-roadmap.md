Hello, I'm working currently on a document viewer module and I would like to know if there's a PDF viewer available. Something like this [https://blazor.syncfusion.com/demos/pdf-viewer/default-functionalities?theme=fabric](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/demos/pdf-viewer/default-functionalities?theme=fabric) in advance thanks, Andrian

Hello Nasoloniaina, We have an open feature request regarding the addition of the PDF viewer component. I have added your Vote for it to increase the popularity of the item and you can Follow it to receive email notifications on status updates. For the time being, you can see the Kendo jQuery widgets in Blazor demo application and the MyKendoPdfViewer component as reference on how to include it in your own application.
