# Access to Blazor components' source code

## Question

**Pet** asked on 27 Dec 2022

I recall being told I would have access to source code once I buy a licence. Now that I have a licence, how do I get access to the source so I can do a local build?

Hi Peter, The source code for Blazor UI components can be downloaded from Telerik.com if you have a license. To do this, log in to your Telerik account at Home | Your Account (telerik.com). Select Downloads and then search for the UI for Blazor product. With the product selected scroll down until you see the Source Code section. I hope this helps. Regards, Justin Progress Telerik
