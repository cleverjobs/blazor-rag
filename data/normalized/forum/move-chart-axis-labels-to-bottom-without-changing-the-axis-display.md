# Move chart axis labels to bottom without changing the axis display

## Question

**Dat** asked on 11 Aug 2021

I would like to display the x date category axis at the bottom. However if I set the AxisCrossingValue then it changes the bar display to appear as if it comes from the bottom. I would like to display the exact same chart however just the date labels at the bottom and leave the 0 axis line where it currently is.
