# Use korean language in TelerikEditor

## Question

**송정훈** asked on 01 Jul 2021

Hi, I am using the telerik blazor component for the first time as a Korean developer. When entering the first consonant in Korean, two consonants are created at the same time. Two identical consonants are also entered when typing the enter key and typing letters on a new line. There is no problem when typing English. If you refer to the attached picture, you will understand quickly. Is there a way for the editor to support Korean input?
