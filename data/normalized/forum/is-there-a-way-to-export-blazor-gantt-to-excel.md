Hi Abby, I submitted a feature request on your behalf for the desired functionality on our Public Feedback Portal: Excel Export for Blazor Gantt. You are automatically subscribed as a creator to receive email notifications for status updates. Once this is implemented, the Excel export will be an available option for the Gantt component.
