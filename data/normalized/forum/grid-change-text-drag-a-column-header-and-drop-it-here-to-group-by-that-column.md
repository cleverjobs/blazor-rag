# Grid: Change Text "Drag a column header and drop it here to group by that column"

## Question

**Hen** asked on 25 Aug 2022

I make it short: Is there any way to customize the text in the GroupPanel or get rid of it (not the Panel itself) ?

Hello Hendrik, You can use the localization files to change the text. In the "Messages.resx" file (that we ship with our demos /in the installation folder of the product/) you can see a key "Group_Empty" and customize the value for that key. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
