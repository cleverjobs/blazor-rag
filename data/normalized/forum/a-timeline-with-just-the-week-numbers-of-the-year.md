# A timeline with just the week numbers of the year

## Question

**Jos** asked on 23 Jan 2023

I am trying to create a timeline component that is just using week numbers of the current year. I am looking at the Gantt chart but not sure how to customise the view to use just week numbers. There is a similar thing for telerik wpf called RadTimeline which is kind of what I want but for Blazor. Here is an example.

Hi Joshua, The described functionality sounds like a good idea for a feature request in the Scheduler component. Therefore, I created a public item for it on your behalf on our Public Feedback Portal: Timeline view that shows the number (1st, 2nd...52nd) of every week throughout the year. That feature will allow you to achieve the desired result. You are automatically subscribed, as a creator, to receive email notifications for status updates. In the meantime, if an alternative approach appears for creating such a timeline, I will post it as a comment at the above link. If we can assist with anything else, I'm at your disposal.
