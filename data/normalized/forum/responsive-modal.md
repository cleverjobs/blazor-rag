# Responsive Modal

## Question

**RobRob** asked on 29 Apr 2020

Is there a way to make the Window, when used as a modal, responsive? Looking for it to act similar to a standard Bootstrap modal ([https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#optional-sizes).](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#optional-sizes).)
