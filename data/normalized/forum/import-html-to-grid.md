Hello Ilan, The TelerikGrid supports Multi-Column Headers. You can see their configuration from our Multi-Column Headers documentation article. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov

Hello Ilan, The Telerik UI for Blazor Grid cannot be automatically generated by external HTML or a data structure. You can bind the Grid to a Data Table and I will encourage you to see the setup from our online demo. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
