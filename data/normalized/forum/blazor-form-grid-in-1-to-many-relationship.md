# Blazor: Form / Grid in 1-to-Many relationship

## Question

**Isa** asked on 22 May 2022

Dear All, The attached document contains a couple of Grid component document that I got from DevExpress and SyncFusion. I am interested in the one that is similar to the image attached, which I got from DevExpress. Does Telerik have something similar to this? I would also like to see one like that image on page 1 that is in 1-to-many relationship, where the form part represents the parent, and the grid part represents the child. I am trying to develop a Blazor application that could mimic what I stated above, especially Form/Grid, where the Form represents the main form (parent), and the Grid, represents the child in a 1-to-many relationship respectively. I got the image from this link: [https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2021/11/12/grid-for-blazor-standard-and-popup-edit-forms-now-available-in-v21-2.aspx](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2021/11/12/grid-for-blazor-standard-and-popup-edit-forms-now-available-in-v21-2.aspx) Your quick response to this request is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Isaiah A.

Hi Isaiah, I have noticed that the current thread is a duplicate of a ticket from our private support system, therefore, I am pasting the answer here: Indeed, the Telerik UI Grid for Blazor exposes the option to edit the items in an external form. Check out our form editing demo. Alternatively, our Popup editing mode features such a form, however, it is inside a Window element. Check out the Popup editing demo. In case any additional clarifications are needed, I recommend that we continue the discussion in this thread. Regards, Tsvetomir Progress Telerik
