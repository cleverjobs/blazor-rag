## Question

Hi, Is it possible to get event when user click/double click task on Gantt chart (grid/timeline). We should update some properties based on selected task. Is it possible to create new dialog for popup editing?

Hi Pasi, We have an open feature request regarding a double click event on our Public Feedback Portal - OnTaskDoubleClick event for the Gantt tasks. I voted there on your behalf and increased the priority of the item. As soon as we expose the event, you will be able to show a custom popup. In the meantime, if we come up with an approach earlier, I will post it in the above public item. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
