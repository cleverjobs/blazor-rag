# Collapse menu in code

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 01 Apr 2021

I am using the OnClick event of the menu to perform some actions and then navigate to the new page (using NavigationManager). The problem I am having is that if the item I clicked on is in a drop down menu, the dropdown is still expanded after the navigation (note the menu is in the MainLayout). Is there anyway I can collapse the menu before (or after) it navigates?
