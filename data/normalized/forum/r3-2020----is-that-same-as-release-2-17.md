# R3 2020 -- is that same as release 2.17

## Question

**Mar** asked on 16 Sep 2020

I'm wondering if R3 2020 is the same as release 2.17 for Telerik UI for Blazor? I received an email about "R3 2020" with a link to the download page and I only see release 2.17 which appears to be the same day. Are they the same? Thanks MM

Hi Mark, In this case - yes, they are, the 2.17.0 version of UI for Blazor matches the R3 2020 release of everything else. We release UI for Blazor much more often than the other suites in the Telerik DevTools portfolio, though, that's why we chose the semVer approach for it. So, the next 2.18.0 will not match the R1 2021 of the other suites. Regards, Marin Bratanov
