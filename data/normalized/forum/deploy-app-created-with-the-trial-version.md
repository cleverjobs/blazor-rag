# Deploy App created with the Trial Version

## Question

**Joh** asked on 08 Sep 2021

I am still evaluating Telerik UI for Blazor and would like to share my POC project with the evaluation team before purchase. I have tried to deploy my POC to an Azure App Service but get a HTTP ERROR 500 when running the web app. I am quit eproficient in the deployment process and have deployed other blazor projects many times. Can I check if the reason for this error is due to running the trial version ? ...

Hi John, Although our license agreement prohibits publishing UI for Blazor in a production environment, there is no specific restriction that will prevent you from doing so. The reason for the error should be something else. On a side note, you will see an occasional trial message on the web page, when using the trial version. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik

Thanks for answering Dimo. Do you have specific instructions for publish a Blazor App to an Azure Web App. I really want to be able to succesfuly deploy a Web App using the Telerik library and know I wont have a lot of support in doing so.

@John - A Blazor app with our components should be published in exactly the same way, as if UI for Blazor is not used. That is why we don't have specific instructions, sorry.
