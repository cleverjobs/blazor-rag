# Styling issue

## Question

**Sim** asked on 16 Apr 2020

The html in bold is generated by the Menu control for a menu item, the non-bold code is from my menu item template. The k-link / k-menu-link styles provides the mouse over and cursor effect. <li class="k-item k-menu-item telerik-blazor" data-id="e5bda03c-693b-4a70-9310-75977f58d39a" role="menuitem" aria-live="polite" tabindex="0" aria-label="Paste"> <span class="k-in k-link k-menu-link "> <span class="lt-menu-item lt-disabled"> <img src="EditPaste.svg"><span>Paste</span> </span> </span> </li> I'm trying to create a disabled menu item, but I realy need to style the k-menu-link span otherwise the effect is not on the full menu item (see image). Any thoughts on how to do this, or would it be possible to provide a property that allows a style to be injected into the <span class="k-in k-link k-menu-link ">

Hello Simon, Would a parameter on the menu like CssClassField solve this? It would be provided from the menu item model like the other fields (say, text), but the menu would render it on the menu item itself (li.k-item), not inside the template? Regards, Marin Bratanov

That sounds like it would would work and allow state specific styling of the whole menu item.
