# Mutiple Resources of the Same Type on the Same Appointment

## Question

**Mat** asked on 16 Jan 2023

Is it possible to have mutiple resources of the same type on the same appointment? For example, in our system we could have a Patient Appointment with multiple physical therapists. In our system the resource ids stored in an appointment is a list not a single value as I have seen your examples. Thanks!
