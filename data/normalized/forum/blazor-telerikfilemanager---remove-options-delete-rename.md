# Blazor TelerikFileManager - Remove Options: Delete, Rename

## Question

**Ric** asked on 23 Sep 2022

I am using the Blazor TelerikFileManager. When the user right-clicks on either a directory of file. The rename, download, and delete option is displayed. I need the options rename and delete to not show up. It is my understanding this functionality is found in some versions of the product but not others. Example, [https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/filemanager](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/filemanager) The example here only shows rename and delete. [https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/file-manager](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/file-manager)
