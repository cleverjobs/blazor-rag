**Vin** asked on 21 Feb 2023

Hi Team, currently i am using blazorise video component in my web application and i have few videos which are in .mp4 and .wmv. i see .mp4 video files are playing without any issues whereas for .wmv video files are not playing and showing blank. Could you please assist and how to play .wmv video files without converting those into .mp4 format. <Video Source="@videoURL" Class="tmVideoPlayer" AutoPlay="true"/>
