# Telerik Timeline Component?

## Question

**Xor** asked on 29 May 2024

Does Telerik UI for Blazor have a Timeline component similar to MudBlazor's? [https://mudblazor.com/components/timeline#opposite](https://mudblazor.com/components/timeline#opposite) I can't seem to find anything similar. Is there someway to create it out of other components?

Hi John, I confirm that we have an open feature request for introducing a Timeline Blazor component: Timeline control request. You can take a look at it. Its current status is Unplanned. I've also voted on your behalf and raised its priority. If you wish to stay updated on its progress, you can also subscribe to receive email notifications for status updates.
