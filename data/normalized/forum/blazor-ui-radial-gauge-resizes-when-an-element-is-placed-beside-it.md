Hello Jason, All our Charts and Gauges resize automatically to fit in their container or the available space in general. If the available space is less, the component will appear smaller. Check this example: REPL with Radial Gauges So it's up to you to allocate the desired amount of space and/or set the Width and Height parameters. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
