# TelerikGrid: CloseOnClick not working when using ShowOn

## Question

**Hen** asked on 11 Oct 2024

I would like to use the TelerikMenu on a mobile device, but there is no hover function to automatically open the menu. I therefore use ShowOn=“@MenuShowEvent.Click”. This also works, but now CloseOnClick=“true” no longer works. If I use the property, the menu no longer opens at all. But I need the function to close the menu automatically after selecting a menu item. How can I achieve this or is it a bug?

Thank you very much. The workaround worked for me. But I do not understand: I have to vote for fixing a problem !?

Hi Hendrik, I can confirm that while voting helps us gauge demand, it’s just one of several factors we consider when prioritizing bug fixes. Our planning process isn't solely based on votes. We use them as a way to track interest and need. Kind Regards, Hristian
