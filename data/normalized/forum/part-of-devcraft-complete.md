Hi Will Ui for Blazor be part of DevCraft Complete? Best Giuseppe

## Answer

Hi Giuseppe, The UI for Blazor suite is part of the DevCraft Ultimate bundle (more details and lists of the bundle contents: [https://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx](https://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx) ). It is also available as a standalone package ( [https://www.telerik.com/purchase/blazor-ui](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/blazor-ui) ). You can also start a trial to test out the components first.

That is great news. I just started using Blazor and realized my current subscription didn't cover it (DevCraft Complete). Do you happen to have an ETA on when this would be available?

Hello Jacob, We are working on this at the moment and so I hope it will be ready soon. I will post in this thread when Blazor is available in the DevCraft Complete bundle. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hi everyone, You should now be able to see and use the UI for Blazor suite as part of your DevCraft license (both Complete and UI), and not just as a trial. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hi. Thanks for this. I see it and have downloaded it. However, it is saying that I need to renew its license. Our DevCraft complete license does not expire until the end of the year.

Hi Brian, At the moment, there is a small issue with some of the online services catering to downloading Blazor through the Telerik Control Panel. We are working on setting it right, and we will get back to you here once it is fixed. In the meantime, you should still be able to download the package from our nuget feed. If not, you can download the zip archive from your account and use it locally. You do not need to install UI for Blazor in order to use the components. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hi Brian, We just shipped the 1.3.0 release and you should be able to download it through the Control Panel if you wish to do so. Regards, Marin Bratanov
