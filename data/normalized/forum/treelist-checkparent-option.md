(UPDATED) Hello Lennert, There is a feature request about a CheckParents parameter for the TreeList. I voted there on your behalf and to raise the priority. You can also subscribe to the item to receive email notifications for status updates. Regards, Nansi Progress Telerik

Hi Nansi, That is not the functionality I'm referring at. I want the functionality controlled by the CheckParents flag of the TreeView component (i.e.: check (indeterminate) state of parent based on children selection), but on the TreeList component. KR Lennert
