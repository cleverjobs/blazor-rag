# Adding a form field after a radio button within a RadioGroup Tag

## Question

**Joh** asked on 11 Jun 2024

I would like to add a numeric box after several of the radio buttons in a Radio Group. Similar to how they are displayed in the Scheduler Appointment entry form. Any suggestions or samples on how to go about doing this using the Telerik Blazor UI tools?
