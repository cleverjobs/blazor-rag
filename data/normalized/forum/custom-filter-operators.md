# Custom Filter Operators

## Question

**Phi** asked on 16 May 2022

It would be greatly beneficial to our projects if there were enhancements to the Filter component to allow for supplying custom Filter Operators. For example, our legacy software provided native "Between" operator support along with custom "Date Range" operators, such as "today", "Yesterday", "This Week", etc. While I wouldn't expect Telerik to support these out of the box, it would be great to be able to add our own operators/Filter types.

Currently, we have a pending Feature Request in our

I would also like to extend the default filters. Why not using a class hierarchy instead of an enum? This way we could add out own subclases. I need my users to be able to have dropdowns for related entities.
