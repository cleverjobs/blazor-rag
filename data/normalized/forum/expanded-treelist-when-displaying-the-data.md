# Expanded TreeList when displaying the data

## Question

**Cip** asked on 24 Sep 2020

Hello, I'm am loading a flat list with parent-child elements (the children elemnt having a reference to the parent element through a ParentId) into an ObservableCollection and when the data is presented in the TreeList Component the parent nodes are collapsed. Is there a possibility to set the treelist to appear with all the parent elements that have children expanded? Best regards, Cipri

Hello Cipri, You can Follow the implementation of such a feature here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1481700-control-the-expanded-collapsed-state-of-treelist-items.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1481700-control-the-expanded-collapsed-state-of-treelist-items.) I've also added a workaround in a second post just now that might be helpful for you. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hello Marin, Thank you for the workaround that you have posted. It worked in our case. For now it's ok like that but we will keep following the development of the TreeList and when this feature to "Control the expanded/collapsed state of treelist items" will be available we will replace the workaround. Thank you again. Best regards, Cipri
