Hi Eric, The ListBox component doesn't currently support this functionality. You can submit a feature request and vote for it here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor?categoryId=2758.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor?categoryId=2758.) Based on a similar older request for their jQuery library ( [https://feedback.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui/1360491-add-ability-to-group-data-in-listbox](https://feedback.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui/1360491-add-ability-to-group-data-in-listbox) ), it seems unlikely that this feature will be implemented. If you don't need features like drag-and-drop, you might consider using the MultiSelect component instead, which does support grouping: [https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/documentation/components/multiselect/grouping](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/documentation/components/multiselect/grouping) Regards, Anislav Atanasov
