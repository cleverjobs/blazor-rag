# Toolbar Buttons do not have a ThemeColor to set for them

## Question

**Pin** asked on 30 Jan 2022

Unlink TelerikButton's, ToolbarButton's do not have a ThemeColor, so cannot change their colour like you could a normal button. This is really an issue as of 3.0.0, not before I should note.

Hi Matthew, Indeed, the ToolbarButtons should also expose options to control their appearance like the regular buttons do ( ThemeColor, FillMode, Size etc. ). We have already scheduled the fix for our 3.1.0 release. In addition, I opened a public bug report on your behalf to cover this case, so any affected parties might be aware of its status. You can find it in our public
