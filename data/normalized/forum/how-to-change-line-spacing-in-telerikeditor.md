# How to change line spacing in TelerikEditor

## Question

**Ric** asked on 10 Apr 2024

Is there a way to change the space between paragraphs? In the example, the lines in the first paragraph have no space between them. Upon pressing Enter and moving to a second paragraph, the Editor includes a space between the first and second paragraph. I want to be able to change that spacing. Is it possible for this component?
