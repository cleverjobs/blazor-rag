# Min/max limits in bar charts

## Question

**Chr** asked on 10 Nov 2022

We would like to add horizontal lines (ideally) or points to each series in a bar chart to indicate minimum and maximum values. The closest solution I can find is to use a line chart, but that doesn't really make sense because there isn't really a relationship between the marks across the series. A different plot band for each series would work, but we need a separate plot band for each series. Another option would be to do the line chart but only show the marks and not the line itself. Any options currently available?
