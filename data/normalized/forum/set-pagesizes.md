# Set PageSizes

## Question

**Pet** asked on 28 Dec 2020

Hi, in Kendo UI asp.net core / Javascript I set the possible Page Sizes: pageable: { pageSizes: [2, 3, 4, "all" ], see [https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/grid/configuration/pageable.pagesizes](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/grid/configuration/pageable.pagesizes) For a new Blazor ServerSide App my client wish also such dropdownlist. In [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/paging](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/paging) I can set the PageSize, but not an Array PageSizes for a dropdownlist in the Pager. How can I add an PageSizes-DropDownlist right of the Button "Go to the last page" in the grid-pager Toolbar? Regards, Peter

Can I vote for this too. With all of the cool things you can do in Grids, it seems like it is missing a pretty basic function of being able to easily allow the user to change the page size.

Hello Randy, Indeed, it's a great feature, and it is something we will add to the component. For a suite that had its first beta barely two years ago, we now have over 65 native components and I'd say the grid is pretty much fully featured - of course, there are a few bits here and there that are lacking compared so suites that have been around for a decade or more, but we're getting there.
