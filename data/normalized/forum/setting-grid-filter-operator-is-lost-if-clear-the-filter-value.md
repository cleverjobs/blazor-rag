**Cla** asked on 23 Jul 2025

Hi, i have a grid with row filter. 1. I change filter operator from the relative button 2. I edit the search field column The grid show me the correct results. Now if i clear the search field column, the filter operator automatically reset to the default value and not keep the settings i choose in step 1. You can reply the issue with the first example in grid documentation: [https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/documentation/components/grid/overview](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/documentation/components/grid/overview) The filter operator must keep my initial settings It's a bug? how to solve? Thanks
