# Programmatically invoke Edit command in Blazor - TelerikListView component.

## Question

**Igo** asked on 28 Feb 2022

I'm using TelerikListView component in Blazor app. I have a template defined with @onclick event and need to programmatically invoke the Edit command in that event. The reason is to show EditTemplate when the user clicks on the whole row, not just some button. Thanks for help.

Hello Igor, Such a feature comes with the State feature in our Blazor suite, and you can Follow it here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1504658-add-state-feature-for-the-listview.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1504658-add-state-feature-for-the-listview.) I hope the workaround can serve for the time being. Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
