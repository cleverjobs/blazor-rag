# Tab strip tab (and grid column header) remove mouseover / hover effect

## Question

**Ric** asked on 22 May 2025

On both the Tab strip selected tab and the grid header, there's a mouseover / hover effect which thickens the bottom border by 1px; Standard; Hover; I've been trying to remove this effect (largely since it causes a height change), but not having any luck identifying the right CSS classes to modify. I still want the selected tab to be highlighted, and if possible to remove the mouseover on unselected tabs - this gives the bottom a thin border with the same height problem. Any help greatly received!

Hi Richard, From the screenshot, it looks like you're using the Fluent theme (Main). I tested our TabStrip and Grid demos with that theme, but hovering over the headers doesn’t seem to change the height or make the blue line thicker on my end. Would it be possible to send a short video showing the effect you’re seeing? That would help me better understand what’s happening. Thanks in advance – I look forward to your reply. Kind Regards, Hris
