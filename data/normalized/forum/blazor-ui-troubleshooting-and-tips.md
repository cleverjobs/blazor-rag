# Blazor UI Troubleshooting and Tips

## Question

**Kat** asked on 01 Sep 2023

I'm diving into the realm of Telerik UI for Blazor, and I've hit a bit of a roadblock that I'm hoping someone can help me with. I'm currently working with the NumericTextBox component, and I'm trying to achieve browser-level auto complete while Virginia DMV online services for vehicle registration DMVNOW Portal maintaining custom formatting for units (like "in", "kg", "cm", etc.).However, I've noticed that when the browser's auto complete history includes the formatting string, it messes up the value handling within the component. This causes the value to disappear before the onchange event triggers, since it's technically a string.Has anyone else encountered this situation?
