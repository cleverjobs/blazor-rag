# Access nuget packages

## Question

**Djo** asked on 06 Dec 2023

I tried to install nuget packages in my new test application and set VS for accessing nuget.telerik.com. After several attempts I was prompt for credentials. Nothing happend, then in second try it works. After that I never entered list of telerik packages with comment Error 401. I tried everything, reset credentials in window credential manager. Even changed my mail trying to reset all but nothing happen. Obviously my credential to enter my telerik account is valid as I am logged in but nuget packages are not available to me.

Hello Djordje, The Telerik account, from which you have posted this thread, doesn't have any active licenses (trial or commercial). So if you are using this account to access our NuGet server, you will not have access to any packages. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
