# Custom logic for sending emails in the ReportView component

## Question

**She** asked on 15 Jul 2025

Is it possible to implement the logic for handling the "Send" button click in the email sending window? I want to notify the user when the email has been sent and display a loading indicator to prevent user interaction with the interface, as sending emails can sometimes take a while.
