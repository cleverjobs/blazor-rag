# Blazor TelerikFileManager - Multiple Upload?

## Question

**n/an/a** asked on 30 Jan 2023

Hi, I am using the Telerik FileManager with the built in Upload. I can't find the mutliple variable in the Upload settings so I guess it is not possible to drag&drop or select mulitple files with this component? It is a major setback for us using this because we need to be able to quicken the process of uploading a large number of files. Did anyone manage to do that? Thank you !
