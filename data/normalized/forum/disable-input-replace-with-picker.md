Hello Zhi Yuan, Perhaps the closest feature we have in mind is showing the popup when the input focuses: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1475760-dropdowns-and-date-time-pickers-open-the-dropdown-on-component-focus.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1475760-dropdowns-and-date-time-pickers-open-the-dropdown-on-component-focus.) In the thread you can also find a few approaches you can try in the meantime to expand the picker. If you don't want the input, you could try hiding it with CSS and, based on your business logic, use an approach like the ones listed above to expand the picker. Regards, Marin Bratanov
