# Customize StockChart Line series markers and navigator From-To settings

## Question

**Iva** asked on 30 Dec 2022

Hello! It is possible to change appearance settings for line' markers? Need to change at least the size and thickness of the border. The current settings look bad with a sufficiently large amount of data (1-100) Especially since it is planned to connect several data series - everything will merge into a heap. And in second - it would be great to implement an event to change the width of the navigator span. In the current view, redrawing the chart resets the From - To values to the original ones, which is inconvenient.
