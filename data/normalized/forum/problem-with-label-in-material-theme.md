# Problem with Label in Material Theme

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 19 Mar 2021

When using the Material theme, the label shows over the text in the textarea when typing and the text scrolls up. This is visible in you demo page. [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/textarea/label](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/textarea/label) Looks like some styling is missing or wrong as it does not happen when using the Default styling.

Hello Bob, We have an open bug report on our Theme repository. We have a new feedback portal to track feature requests and bug reports that are connected to the themes. I have opened a new bug report ( The floating label for the Textarea overlaps the text ) there so that other people from the community can see it and vote for it.
