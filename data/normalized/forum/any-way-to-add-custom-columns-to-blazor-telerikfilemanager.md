# Any way to add custom columns to Blazor TelerikFileManager?

## Question

**Chr** asked on 18 Dec 2023

Is there any way to add your own columns to the list view of the file manager in addition to the default columns, or are you limited to the default columns of name, date created and file size? In general, how easy is it to customize the appearance and data displayed? Is it easy to extend the component with custom behavior?

Hi Christopher, Feature requests for such customizations in the FileManager have already been submitted on our Public Feedback Portal: Add option to customize FileManager Grid columns Add option to customize FileManager Preview (Details) Pane You can vote for the items to increase their priority.

What is your process for picking items from the public feedback? This was asked for a year ago.

Hi Jason, I can confirm that the fact that it hasn’t been addressed over the past two years doesn’t mean it’s off the table. During this time, other high-priority features have taken precedence. When determining the priority of a feature, we consider various factors, with votes being just one part of the equation. Below I have prepared for you a summary of the key factors that influence item prioritization: For each feature, we evaluate the following: Will this item impact other components? For instance, if it applies to one input component, it might also affect other input components. Is there a viable alternative to achieve the same outcome? Is the item related to an important/main functionality or a rather specific one? Number of customers that provide interest(number of votes). What are the short-term and long-term goals of the product, represented in the Roadmap? I hope this information provides more clarity on our process. Thank you for your understanding. Kind Regards, Hristian
