Hi Abby, To modify the column width on the timeline views, use the SlotWidth parameter. The default width of the columns is 100px. You can refer to this REPL example to see the result of the SlotWidth change. I hope the available parameter serves you well in continuing with your project. Regards, Tsvetomir Progress Telerik
