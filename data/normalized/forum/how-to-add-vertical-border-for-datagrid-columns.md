Hi Charith, Yes, it is possible to control which cell borders are displayed when you have locked grid columns. In this case, the CSS selectors will be a bit different. You can use.k-grid-content-sticky and.k-grid-header-sticky to select the cells and headers of the locked (sticky) columns, and then remove their borders as shown below: <style>.k-grid-content-sticky,.k-grid-header-sticky { border-inline-end-width: 0!important;
} </style> You can check out the example that I set up: [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/mTudurFJ446V7xg721](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/mTudurFJ446V7xg721) Regards, Anislav Atanasov

Thanks Anislav, What's the best way to apply this style only for the last sticky column? I want to display the border only for the last locked column, other locked columns do not have a border. I tried with last column HeaderClass that doesn't seem to work and GridColumn does not has Class property. Attached screenshot shows what I want to achieve. I"ve a updated PERL to demonstrate the issue. I want to apply style-forunit-Price class for the last locked column in this example Telerik REPL for Blazor - The best place to play, experiment, share & learn using Blazor.

One possible solution is to use the data-col-index attribute that the Grid assigns to columns. While this approach works, keep in mind that you'll need to update your CSS selector if you add more sticky columns. Hereâ€™s a CSS selector that achieves this: .k-grid-content-sticky:not ( td [data-col-index="1" ] ),.k-grid-header-sticky:not ( th [data-col-index="1" ] ) { border-inline-end-width: 0!important;
} You can also check out this REPL example that demonstrates the approach: [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/GJknbukW40sMb7A336.](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/GJknbukW40sMb7A336.) Regards, Anislav Atanasov
