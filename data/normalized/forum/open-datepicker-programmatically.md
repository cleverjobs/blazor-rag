Hi Doug, You can indeed open the DatePicker component programmatically. It provides various API methods, but the ones relevant to this problem are Open and Close. You can access them by capturing a reference to the DatePicker component using the @ref attribute. I'm providing an example using the Telerik REPL platform: Open DatePicker Programatically Regards, Georgi Progress Telerik
