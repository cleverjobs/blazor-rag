# Loading Shapes from SQL Server Geography Fields.

## Question

**Cur** asked on 15 Oct 2024

In Winforms we use the SqlGeospatialDataReader to load polygons and multipolygons that are stored in SQL geography fields into the RadMap control. Is there something similar for the Blazor Map control? If no, would you recommend loading these shapes into the Blazor version of the map control?
