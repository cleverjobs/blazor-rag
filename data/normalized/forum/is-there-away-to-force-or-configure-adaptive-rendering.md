# Is there away to force, or configure adaptive rendering ?

## Question

**Ric** asked on 16 Apr 2023

Is there a way to force adaptive rendering ? We have a blazor app inside a maui build, and when built for windows app, it does not trigger adaptive rendering at the size we need. Is there a way to force adaptive rendering on, or configure when it will switch ?
