# Change column order for generated columns

## Question

**Chr** asked on 24 Jan 2024

We're using a TelerikGrid with Row Drag & Drop and Hierarchy, which generate icon columns in the grid as shown below. Column 1 for drag & drop, column 2 for the hierarchy expansion. However, we'd like to change the order of these columns around, for example we'd like to put a checkbox column in as the first column. Is this possible?

Hi Chris, This may be possible in the future. We have a feature request about the order index of the drag and drop column, which can be propagated to all autogenerated service columns. I voted on your behalf and you can follow it too. Currently it is possible to hide the built-in expand column and use a template column for hierarchy expand / collapse via the Grid state. The same is rather infeasible for the drag column, because you will have to implement the whole drag-and-drop feature manually. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
