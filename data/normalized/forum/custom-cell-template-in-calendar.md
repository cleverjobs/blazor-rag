# Custom Cell template in Calendar

## Question

**Grz** asked on 30 Jun 2022

Hello, Is there any way to set custom template to calendar's cell. I'm not writing about css class, but also structure - I want to add additional data to cell (like number work hours in each day). Thanks.

Hello Grzesiek, We already have multiple templates that allow control over the rendering of the cells. You can see that from our Templates Overview article that links all available templates. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov Progress Telerik
