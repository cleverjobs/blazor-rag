# Inquiry on Implementing Virtualization with Continuous Scroll with Teleriklistview

## Question

**Ani** asked on 17 Mar 2023

Dear Telerik Support Team, I am a licensed customer from AVEVA and I am reaching out to inquire about how to implement virtualization with continuous scroll in Telerik UI for Blazor using C#. I am specifically interested in the TelerikListView component and would like to implement this feature to improve the performance of my application. I have already looked through the documentation and examples on your website, but I couldn't find any information on how to achieve virtualization with continuous scroll. As a valued customer, I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide some guidance or examples on how to implement virtualization with continuous scroll in Telerik UI for Blazor. Thank you very much for your help in advance. Best regards, Anil Kumar Dasari
