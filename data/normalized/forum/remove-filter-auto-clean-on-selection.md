# Remove filter auto-clean on selection

## Question

**Osc** asked on 27 Apr 2021

Hello, I would like to avoid componente cleans filter user input when an item is clicked and auto-close is set to false. So, imagine I want to select every item which contains letter 'S'. I type 'S' then when I click on the first item containing 'S', the 'S' in the input is removed and all the items are shown. So I need to type S again and again 1 time for each Item I want to select. I attach a gif showing the behaviour. Is there any way to avoid this input cleaning on selection? Thanks.
