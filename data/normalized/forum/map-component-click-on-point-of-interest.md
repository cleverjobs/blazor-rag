# Map Component Click on Point of Interest

## Question

**Mat** asked on 06 Mar 2024

On the map component when zoomed in there are labels for points of interest (businesses/airports/hotels/restaurants/etc..) Is it possible to capture these when a user clicks on an item? I know I can capture the lat/long of a click but can I get the details of the point of interest?
