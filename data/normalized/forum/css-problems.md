Hi guys, Are you making changes on this file: [https://unpkg.com/@progress/kendo-theme-default@5.0.0/dist/all.css](https://unpkg.com/@progress/kendo-theme-default@5.0.0/dist/all.css) I'm asking because some of my components are looking messy. Best regards, Cipri

Hello Cipri, We released 3.0 Blazor release that integrates the 5.0.0 kendo-themes version. However, for versions <3.0.0 you need to use the 4.x.x version of the themes. Telerik.UI.for.Blazor package comes with themes as static asset and we recommend that you use it in your projects because we have performed testing and it is the officially supported theme. You could review the following article that explains the themes configuration: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/styling-and-themes/overview](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/styling-and-themes/overview) Regarding our 3.0.0 release, we have provided a breaking changes article that covers all changes: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upgrade/breaking-changes/3-0-0](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upgrade/breaking-changes/3-0-0) Regards, Joana
