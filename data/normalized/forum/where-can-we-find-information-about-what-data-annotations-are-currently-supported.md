# Where can we find information about what Data Annotations are currently supported?

## Question

**imw** asked on 13 Jan 2022

Is there a list of what data annotations is actually supported where in Telerik Blazor? What I have found you only link to Microsofts page about Data Annotation but that included the ApplyFormatInEditMode but obvioulsy it isn't supported. No need to report issues if you are already aware of them so it would be helpful to have this documentation (and updated).

Hello Patrik, Thank you for your feedback! Currently, you can find examples of the most commonly used Data Annotation attributes in the documentation of the specific components that support validation - for example, Grid, TreeList, Form, Inputs. However, we indeed do not have such a resource listing all the supported Data Annotation attributes. Having this in mind, we will consider adding it. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva
