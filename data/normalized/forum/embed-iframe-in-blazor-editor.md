# Embed iFrame in Blazor Editor

## Question

**Pau** asked on 27 May 2021

Hello, I try to insert a YouTube iFrame into the editor but it is automatically removed from the editor. Even when I use the "Edit HTML" function it is removed on save. How can I embed a YouTube video or other iFrame? Thanks for your support!

I just noticed, that it is also not possible to insert a <video> tag. Is there a way to insert those?
