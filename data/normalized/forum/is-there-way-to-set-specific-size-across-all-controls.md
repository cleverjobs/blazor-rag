# Is there way to set specific size across all controls?

## Question

**Mic** asked on 25 Aug 2022

I find the Blazor controls take up a lot of space with large amounts of padding and margin. The controls are just too large for my taste. I see a few posts about a new feature which allows small / medium / large sizes but this is still very arbitrary when trying to design a specific layout. Is there a way to make controls a certain percentage size across a page? So either specific controls or the entire page could be set to say 1% to 5000% and all CSS will resize in proportion?

Hello Michael, I have to admit there is no built-in way to achieve the described component resizing. A possible current option is number 2 on this list of customization alternatives. We are working on a way to reduce the manual work with this regard, but it's too early to be specific. So if you need immediate or short-term solution, follow the guidance as is. ("Short-term" means less than a few months.) Regards, Dimo
