# Collapse/Expand Handle for Drawer Component

## Question

**Kel** asked on 11 Jul 2021

Does the capability exist to style the Drawer component to have a "handle" to enable expanding and collapsing as shown in the attached images? Or, would this be an enhancement request? Thanks, -Kelly

Hi Kelly, Thank you for your feedback and you are correct. At this time, an element within the rendered component to handle the expand/collapse is not available and will need a feature request. As a result, I have gone ahead and created the feature request at the Collapse/Expand Handle Component link. Additionally, I have cast a vote on your behalf. I encourage following the item to receive updates. Please let me know if you need any additional information. Thank you for choosing Telerik UI for Blazor.

Thank you for the example code, much appreciated. What would be the best way to hide the contents of the drawer when the drawer is in the collapse state? In your example the content is still visible when closed.

We like to keep ticket separated by topic to ensure the best support experience is provided. Since this original inquiry has been resolved through the feature request, I created a new ticket for your that can be found through the Telerik Account at 1530099. Any communication related to it should be handled there. Note that it may require additional information as well.
