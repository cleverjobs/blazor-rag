# Abbreviation for Days of Week

## Question

**Zhi** asked on 20 Jan 2021

Hello, This example from ASP.NET AJAX ([https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/scheduler/mobile-examples/overview/default.aspx?name=overview)](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/scheduler/mobile-examples/overview/default.aspx?name=overview)) displays days as "Mon", "Tues" etc, whereas Blazor's Scheduler displays "Monday", "Tuesday" etc. Is there a way to abbreviate the days of week for Blazor Scheduler? This helps to prevent overflow on smaller screens. Thanks!
