# TelerikCalendar Select a whole week

## Question

**KimKim** asked on 13 Jul 2021

Hi, I try to implement a calendar there i use Range selection mode. I want the user only to click on the start range and then we will set end range in code based on the start range date. So i have set an RangeStartChanged event handler and that works but the gui component think i am in select end Range date so i want to exit the selection state after i have select Start date. Is there anyway to do that?
