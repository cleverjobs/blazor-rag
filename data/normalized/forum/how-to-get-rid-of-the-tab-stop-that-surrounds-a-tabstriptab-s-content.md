# How to get rid of the tab stop that surrounds a <TabStriptab>'s <Content>?

## Question

**Rev** asked on 03 Jul 2023

I have a space with multiple tabs and once you get to the end of the multiple tabs, there is a tab stop that encases all of the currently selected tab's content. I am wanting to know if it is possible to remove this? Thanks!
