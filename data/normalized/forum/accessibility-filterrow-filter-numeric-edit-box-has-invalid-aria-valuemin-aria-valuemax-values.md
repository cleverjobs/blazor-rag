Hi Leon, Let's keep the conversation from here as well in the original public item for better visibility: [Accessibility] FilterRow filter numeric edit box has invalid aria-valuemin/aria-valuemax values. I will get back there with more updates very soon. Thank you for your cooperation. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
