# Grid has no style

## Question

**Bla** asked on 13 Nov 2022

I have attached a screenshot. I copied documentation from: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/overview#creating-blazor-data-grid](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/overview#creating-blazor-data-grid) I'm using version 2.24.0 is this why there is no styling?

Hi Blair, It looks like our theme is not registered. There are three alternative ways to do it - static asset from the NuGet package CDN local file See our Themes documentation and revisit the step-by-step tutorial. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
