# Readonly Stepper

## Question

**Eri** asked on 11 Aug 2022

Is there a way to put the stepper control in a read-only mode so the user can't click on the steps and trigger events? I can disable it, but then it grays out the control. Thanks in advance,

What is the difference between the current question and the other one for read-only Stepper from a week ago?
