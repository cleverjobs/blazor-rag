Is there a way to position a dialog/window next to the button that opened it?

Hi Ilan, Coupled anchor - popup positioning is usually more common for tooltips, but if you prefer a full-blown popup, then it is possible to achieve this with the Window. Of course, you will need to obtain/calculate the exact coordinates manually. Regards, Dimo
