That's quite an open-ended question, Eric, and the answer is "it depends" - if you want to change colors, for example, likely making a custom theme for your entire app will be rather easy with the theme builder. If you want to change something relatively simple on all instances - likely a few css overrides added to the app stylesheet will do. The more specific the changes you want, the more work it will need.
