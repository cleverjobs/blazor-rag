Hi Paul, The described problem can appear if there is an old browser cache. You can try clearing the cache: Right-click on the page, and click " Inspect ". Right-click on the " Reload " button of the browser in the top left corner while the inspect is open. Choose from the dropdown - " Empty Cache and Hard Reload ". I carefully tested the example. It seems to work as expected in Edge on my machine. I'm attaching a screenshot to show the result as well (see " edge-grid-display.png "). Let me know how things turned out. Kind Regards, Hristian
