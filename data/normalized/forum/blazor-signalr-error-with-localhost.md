# Blazor SignalR Error With LocalHost

## Question

**Dus** asked on 17 Apr 2023

This might not be the correct place to ask this, but you all have been so much help the past that I figured I'd ask here. I'm running into a brand new issue where connecting to SignalR in debug(localhost) is no longer working, but the odd part is that everything works just fine in production. My code (red arrow is where it fails): The error: System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.IO.IOException: The request was aborted. ---> System.IO.IOException: The response ended prematurely while waiting for the next frame from the server. at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.<ReadFrameAsync>g__ThrowMissingFrame|69_1() at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.ReadFrameAsync(Boolean initialFrame) at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.ProcessIncomingFramesAsync() --- End of inner exception stack trace --- at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.ThrowRequestAborted(Exception innerException) at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.Http2Stream.CheckResponseBodyState() at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.Http2Stream.TryEnsureHeaders() at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.Http2Stream.ReadResponseHeadersAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean async, CancellationToken cancellationToken) --- End of inner exception stack trace --- at System.Net.Http.Http2Connection.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean async, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionPool.SendWithVersionDetectionAndRetryAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean async, Boolean doRequestAuth, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at System.Net.Http.DiagnosticsHandler.SendAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean async, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at System.Net.Http.RedirectHandler.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean async, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.Internal.AccessTokenHttpMessageHandler.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.Internal.LoggingHttpMessageHandler.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at System.Net.Http.HttpClient.<SendAsync>g__Core|83_0(HttpRequestMessage request, HttpCompletionOption completionOption, CancellationTokenSource cts, Boolean disposeCts, CancellationTokenSource pendingRequestsCts, CancellationToken originalCancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnection.NegotiateAsync(Uri url, HttpClient httpClient, ILogger logger, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnection.GetNegotiationResponseAsync(Uri uri, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnection.SelectAndStartTransport(TransferFormat transferFormat, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnection.StartAsyncCore(TransferFormat transferFormat, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnection.StartAsync(TransferFormat transferFormat, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnectionFactory.ConnectAsync(EndPoint endPoint, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnectionFactory.ConnectAsync(EndPoint endPoint, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.HubConnection.StartAsyncCore(CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.HubConnection.StartAsyncInner(CancellationToken cancellationToken) at Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.HubConnection.StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) at HammertimeApp.Pages.TelerikLayout.GetConnection() Since I am using SignalR to refresh user data in a large portion of my app, I'm currently at a standstill with debugging any new errors. Any help would be greatly appreciated! -Dustin

Disregard. It's fixed now. I believe I solved my error by restarting my Auzre service.
