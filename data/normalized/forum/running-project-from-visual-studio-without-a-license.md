# Running project from Visual Studio without a license

## Question

**imw** asked on 22 Dec 2021

Hi, Surprisingly, I was not able to find an answer how to solve this so thus this post. We are two developers developing a Blazor Server Side Project. I am the one doing all the GUI / Blazor stuff and my colleague is doing only Domain and Database. Now, the problem is that in order to run any of his code, he needs to be able to run the Blazor project from Visual Studio which turns out to be problematic as he does not have a license for Telerik and don't need one as he is never working with the controls or even Blazor. How would he go about to solve this without having to buy a license he would never use? If there is no obvious solution, please provide a good workaround. Thanks.
