# Tab doesn't work

## Question

**Rob** asked on 24 Oct 2022

I have a filterable virtualized ComboBox, using OnRead to load data. Pressing TAB while the ComboBox has focus doesn't work, nothing happens. Shift-TAB works as expected.

Hi Robert, I've tested the ComboBox behavior using this example from our documentation. However, I am not able to reproduce such behavior. Pressing Tab while the ComboBox is focused successfully focuses the next element on the page - see video attached of the result I am getting. Can you please send us a recording of the behavior you are referring to? A runnable sample that reproduces it would also be helpful. Thank you in advance!
