# Expanding default FilterMenu with default FilterDescriptors

## Question

**WVWV** asked on 06 Jul 2023

Perhaps a silly question but wanted to do a sanity check anyway. I know there are several ways to build custom filter descriptors and custom filter menus with the FilterMenuTemplate. I just want to use the existing default FilterDescriptors but more instances of them without re-creating the entire FilterMenu. For example, instead of having the default two FilterDescriptors with the Logic operator separating them, have three or four, all separated with a Logical Operator.

Hello WV, I can provide two comments on this matter - You need to create the whole FilterMenu manually, as you correctly assumed. You can also use a Filter component inside or outside the FilterMenu - this will make the UI construction easier. Regards, Dimo
