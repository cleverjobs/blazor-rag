# Right ListBox Move Item to Left ListBox

## Question

**Jac** asked on 23 May 2025

hi, I have a question, why can I move from the left ListBox Control to the right ListBox Control by just selecting any item, but on the contrary, if I select any item from the right ListBox Control, I need to select any item from the left ListBox Control to move to the left? I know they use connection subscription, but is there a solution to make it possible to move from the right ListBox Control to the left ListBox Control by just selecting any item?
