# Hierarchical drawer navigation

## Question

**Duo** asked on 28 Jun 2023

Hi, I'm using Hierarchical Drawer with children & navigation and I'm following this docs: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/drawer/hierarchical-drawer.](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/drawer/hierarchical-drawer.) I want when I click on DrawerItem, it will navigate to blazor component. I don't know where to put navigate function on. Do you have any suggestions? Thanks in advance.
