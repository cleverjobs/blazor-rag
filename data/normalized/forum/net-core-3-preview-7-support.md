Hello, Now that .net core 3 preview 7 is out, when can we expect Blazor UI to support it?

Hello Andrew, We are working on it as I am writing this. We expect the update to be live by the end of the week (of course, if no showstoppers appear). I will write back here to let you know when it is live. Regards, Marin Bratanov

I am happy to announce that the 1.4.0 release that is compatible with Preview 7 is available for download from our NuGet feed and from your accounts. There is an outstanding issue with the Visual Studio templates for creating new applications - the client-side application templates are broken, and we have to wait for Microsoft to fix this.
