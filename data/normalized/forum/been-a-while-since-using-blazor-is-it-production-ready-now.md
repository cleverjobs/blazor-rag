# Been a while since using Blazor is it production ready now?

## Question

**Bit** asked on 13 May 2020

Last point I was using Blazor there was still some that suggested not using it in a production environment, whether the Telerik controls or the reliance on the beta versions of .net core and/or Visual Studio 2019. Are all those issues gone now?

Hello Randar, Blazor WebAssembly (client-side) is still in previews and is not production ready. Once it is released (by the end of the month) by Microsoft we will have a compatibility release right away. So far the Blazor Server-side is production ready. Having said that, our components are production ready as they are. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov

Thanks Svetoslav, time for me to take another look. The ability to remove javascript from my line-of-business applications and still get SPA-like behavior is the big plus.

Hello Randal, I am happy to hear that you will consider our Blazor components. From what I can see you are using Telerik UI for Blazor 2.12.0, however today we made a new release with some great features and components and you can consider upgrading to 2.13.0 (more information on upgrading here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upgrade/overview](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upgrade/overview) ).
