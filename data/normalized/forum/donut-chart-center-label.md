Hi Ilan, You can Follow the implementation of a center template here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1424806-center-template-for-donut-type-charts](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1424806-center-template-for-donut-type-charts) (I see you have added your Vote there at the end of February, and the best way to know when it becomes available is the Follow button). As for percentages - you can enable the series labels, see more in the docs: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/chart/labels-template-and-format.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/chart/labels-template-and-format.)
