Hi Timothy, You can put a Pager component in the grid toolbar and it will be at the top of the grid: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/pager/integration.](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/pager/integration.) If you want the pager only on the toolbar, you can use CSS to hide the default pager at the bottom. Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
