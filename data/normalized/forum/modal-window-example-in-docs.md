# Modal Window Example in docs

## Question

**Ros** asked on 26 Apr 2019

It would be great to have a Modal Window example added to the docs [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor/components/window/overview](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor/components/window/overview) I use modal user controls in WPF quite a bit for submitting lengthy forms. sometime the modal has check boxes so it is a bit more complex than a browser alert. Cheers Ross

I stumbled across this post [https://www.telerik.com/blogs/creating-a-reusable-javascript-free-blazor-modal](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/creating-a-reusable-javascript-free-blazor-modal) Which does a pretty good job of showing how to do one, maybe it could be incorporated into the docs somehow later. Thanks

Hello Ross, Thank you for your feedback. We will add a documentation article illustrating modality of the Window. The component has a Modal property that controls it. You could find an example in our demo application: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor/window/modal](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor/window/modal) Regards, Joana
