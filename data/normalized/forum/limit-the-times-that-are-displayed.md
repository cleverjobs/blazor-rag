# Limit the times that are displayed?

## Question

**Dou** asked on 27 Oct 2020

I have a TelerikDateTimePicker on a form and limit the time to 15 minute intervals (00, 15, 30, 45) on form validation but the testers are asking if we can limit the times displayed in the time portion of the date time picker to only show 00, 15, 30 and 45. Is there any way to do that?
