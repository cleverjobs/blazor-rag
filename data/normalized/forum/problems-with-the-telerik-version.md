Hello Jurgen, The issue you are observing is most likely connected to either referencing an old script or to an old script being cached. To resolve this, first try clearing the browser cache, after which please make sure you are using the latest script as per our Getting Started article. Note the script path is different based on whether you are using a trial version or not. Lastly, you might find the following troubleshooting article related to JavaScript errors.
