# Issue with 1.3.0 when deploying to IIS

## Question

**Ken** asked on 16 Jul 2019

I am running 1.3.0 and .Net Core preview 6 This is a server side Blazor application. Locally the project runs fine, but when I deploy to IIS I get the following error when I hit the page: An error occurred while starting the application. DirectoryNotFoundException: C:\Users\longk\.nuget\packages\telerik.ui.for.blazor\1.3.0\staticwebassets\ Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.PhysicalFileProvider..ctor(string root, ExclusionFilters filters) DirectoryNotFoundException: C:\Users\longk\.nuget\packages\telerik.ui.for.blazor\1.3.0\staticwebassets\ Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.PhysicalFileProvider..ctor(string root, ExclusionFilters filters) Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.PhysicalFileProvider..ctor(string root) Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticWebAssetsFileProvider..ctor(string pathPrefix, string contentRoot) Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticWebAssetsLoader+<>c.<UseStaticWebAssetsCore>b__2_0(ContentRootMapping cr) System.Linq.Enumerable+SelectEnumerableIterator<TSource, TResult>.MoveNext() System.Linq.Enumerable.OfTypeIterator<TResult>(IEnumerable source)+MoveNext() System.Collections.Generic.List<T>..ctor(IEnumerable<T> collection) System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList<TSource>(IEnumerable<TSource> source) Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticWebAssetsLoader.UseStaticWebAssetsCore(IWebHostEnvironment environment, Stream manifest) Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticWebAssetsLoader.UseStaticWebAssets(IWebHostEnvironment environment) Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost+<>c.<ConfigureWebDefaults>b__9_0(WebHostBuilderContext ctx, IConfigurationBuilder cb) Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Internal.GenericWebHostBuilder+<>c__DisplayClass8_0.<ConfigureAppConfiguration>b__0(HostBuilderContext context, IConfigurationBuilder builder) Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostBuilder.BuildAppConfiguration() Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostBuilder.Build() ScheduledFeatureEditor.Program.Main(string[] args) in Program.cs NOTE: The directory that is saying is not found is my local directory on the build machine, not the server that I deployed to. I'm not sure where that is coming from. I am not using static assets (or at least I don't think I am). Here is my script reference from _Host.cshtml: <script src="[https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/blazor/1.3.0/telerik-blazor.min.js"](https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/blazor/1.3.0/telerik-blazor.min.js") defer></script> Here are some snippets from Startup that show I am including the telerik blazor stuff: public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddRazorPages(); services.AddServerSideBlazor(); services.AddTelerikBlazor(); And also I am including static file handling in startup: app.UseStaticFiles(); If I change the code to use the static asset version like this: <script src="_content/telerikuiforblazor/js/telerik-blazor.js" defer></script> and then redeploy I get the same error. Any ideas? Thanks, Kenny Long

Hi Kenny, I just answered your support ticket on this matter, and I am pasting my response here for anyone else having the same problem. Am I correct in understanding that by "deploy" you mean that the IIS server is a different PC than yours? If so, you are likely hitting this issue: [https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/11185](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/11185) which should be fixed in the upcoming Preview 7. The stack trace does not include our methods, which is why I believe it is the issue with the static asset handling in the framework. We had a similar report ( here ) which also indicates that perhaps the "publish" package is not enough and installing the full .NET Core 3 SDK on the server may help. So, if you can give that a shot, I'd appreciate if you let me know how it went. Regards, Marin Bratanov
