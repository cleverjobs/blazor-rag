Hello Hendrik, The Telerik ThemeBuilder is an application that allows you to create a custom theme and style the Telerik/Kendo UI components. The AppBar component is available in other suites like Kendo UI; however, it is currently not included in the Telerik UI for Blazor package. We have an open feature request for an AppBar component that you can find in our public feedback portal: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1431587-application-bar-component](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1431587-application-bar-component) I added a vote on your behalf to increase its popularity, as we prioritize the implementation of feature requests based on community interest and demand. You can also subscribe to receive email notifications when its status changes. This is the best way to keep track of the component's progress. Once we know which release will include its implementation, we will update its status in the feedback portal, and you will be notified via email accordingly. Regards, Yanislav Progress Telerik
