# Scroll up in virtual TelerikGrid

## Question

**Joh** asked on 23 Nov 2023

When scrolling up in a virtual grid, the rows "above" seems to not be kept or loaded like when scrolling down, and it takes a while before they gets "loaded" and shown. This behaviour is not very user friendly and should be corrected. I can accept a certain time of delay when doing large scrolls using the scrollbar, but not when doing a scroll-wheen or page-up scroll. Unless I missed something in the grid properties? I got the PageSize set.

Hi Johan, I agree with you that the described behavior can be improved in terms of UX. I am logging a feature request on your behalf to load and render rows before the current page of visible ones. In the meantime, I must confirm that there is no workaround. Sorry about that. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
