# Change scheduler event cell size

## Question

**Akm** asked on 03 Jun 2024

How can I change the height of the scheduler event? All I could find for changing event template was ItemTemplate but that doesn't help to change the height of the cell. Is there a way to achieve that?

Hello Akmar, For the desired functionality there is an already open feature request in our feedback portal: Add AppointmentHeight parameter. I voted for it on your behalf and raised its priority. Currently, its status is Unplanned. You can also subscribe to the item to get notified of any status updates via email. In the meantime, if any workaround appears, we will share it in the comments section of the public items. Regards, Tsvetomir Progress Telerik
