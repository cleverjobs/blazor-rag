# Vertical TabStrip requires fixed Height?

## Question

**Had** asked on 10 Jun 2025

Hi, I am using again the TabStrip component so that it's displayed vertically as in my previous post tabstrip vertical, from what I understand, it has to have an absolute value as pixels in the Height property to render/displays correctly, right ? If so, is support planned for the future? Thanks in advance
