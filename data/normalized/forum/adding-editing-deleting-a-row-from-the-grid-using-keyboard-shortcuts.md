## Question

**Cip** asked on 28 Sep 2022

Hello, Is there a possibility to extend the Keyboard Navigation or a solution which will allow the user based on some keyboard shortcuts to add/edit/delete a row in a grid when the grid edit mode is Inline? For example: Ctrl+N: adds a new row in grid Ctrl+M: the selected row enters in the Edit Mode Ctrl+D: The selected row is Deleted Thank you in advance. Best regards, Cipri
