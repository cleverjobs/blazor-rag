Hello Ilan, There are a few options to handle the case: Set a larger Chart Height Set a StartAngle to the ChartSeries Change the ChartSeriesLabels Position Use shorter labels on a single line - this will not prevent clipping on its own, but can help in combination with another approach. See Blazor Donut Chart Documentation. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
