# Telerik pop ups

## Question

**kha** asked on 25 Jun 2020

Hello, i was hoping that you could add a property to elements which have pop ups so we can assign a class to their pop ups like PopupWidth you could add PopupClass this helps a lot with customization in my situation im trying to change style of TelerikDropDownList to make a color picker but i cant customize popup very well or maybe if there was a way to use popup functionality with our own ui

Hello Khashayar, I would like to answer the questions in turn. The class for the dropdown: There is an open Feature Request on our Feedback Portal regarding this, you can see it from here. You can Follow it to receive email notifications on status updates. The Color Picker component: I have created a Feature Request regarding the creation of such component. You can see it from this link, I have given a Vote on your behalf and you can Follow it for email notifications. On using the dropdown with your own UI: We provide an ItemTemplate which will allow you to fully customize the content of the popup. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov

Hello Khashayar, What I can suggest is that you use the Animation container and use it to create your own custom popup or dropdown which you would have complete control over. You can find a basic example here. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
