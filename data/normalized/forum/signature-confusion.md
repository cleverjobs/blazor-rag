# Signature confusion

## Question

**Rob** asked on 24 Oct 2023

Between the Signature Component and the PDF Processing component I'm having a hard time figuring out how to present a pdf file on a Blazor page for the user to read. Then have a user provide their signature and save that file with the signature imbedded. I feel like I'm missing and or confusing steps here.. Can someone help me out?

Hello Robert, Adding a signature to a PDF document requires adding and editing annotations, which is currently not supported. Sorry about that. Please refer to this feature request about PDFViewer annotations for more information. If applicable, consider storing the user's signature separately. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
