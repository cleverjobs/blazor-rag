# Is there a Spreadsheet component planned for UI for Blazor?

## Question

**TomTom** asked on 25 Apr 2022

I specifically need the functionality of selecting a group of cells in a grid and pasting them to another part of the grid. This is not possible in your grids, but I see it would work in spreadsheet components you have in other sets of controls. But the Blazor set of controls does not have this component yet - is it planned?

Hello Tom, You can Follow its implementation here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1442151-spreadsheet-component](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1442151-spreadsheet-component) For the time being perhaps using the Kendo jQuery one could be an option (see the post at the end).
