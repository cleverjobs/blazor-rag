# Export Selected?

## Question

**Jas** asked on 04 Aug 2021

Is there a way to Export Selected items from the Grid? If not, I'm guessing the easiest way would be to create our own Export functionality?

Hi Jason, You are correct on both counts. You can click the Follow button here to see if/when such a feature becomes available in the grid, and I've added your Vote already: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1510436-export-custom-data-to-excel.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1510436-export-custom-data-to-excel.) You can also find a sample of creating the file on your own too. Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
