# Linear flow but forward only (skipping back is allowed)?

## Question

**Dea** asked on 18 Sep 2024

Hi. I have a requirement I'm stumped with. The client has a wizard and they want to enforce linear flow when moving forwards in the wizard, but they want it to be possible to skip back more than one step at a time. So on any given step you can only go forwards one step, but you can go back more than one. I can't think of any way to do this - is it possible? Thanks, Dean

Hello Dean, I confirm that such customization is not supported. Consider using custom buttons in the Wizard UI that will help users skip steps in either direction and move to a specific one. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
