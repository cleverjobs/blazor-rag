# Scheduler highlight columns for time

## Question

**Chr** asked on 14 Oct 2024

Hello, with TelerikScheduler, I want to be able to highlight certain hours and apply a custom logic. For example in the attached file picture, can it function like Outlook when it is in Schedule View? I want to be able to highlight like in the picture, 3:30pm to 4:30pm, and then do something in the background. Does TelerikScheduler allow something like this?

In addition to my question, if not a custom logic, is there a way to resemble Outlook Schedule View, where highlighting certain hours can indicate if a time block is free or busy for a collection of users?
