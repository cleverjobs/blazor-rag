# Expand Direction Left

## Question

**EliEli** asked on 22 Jun 2020

I have a scenario I did not see how to fix. I have a menu aligned top right with sub menus. It expands down and then to the right. The sub menu items on the screen edge stay on the screen but cover the menu items underneath. Is there a way to expand to the left?
