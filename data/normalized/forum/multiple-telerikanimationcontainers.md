# Multiple TelerikAnimationContainers?

## Question

**Jus** asked on 08 Dec 2021

I feel a bit silly not being able to find the "right" solution to this, but here it goes... I see the Blazor Card demos has an Expandable demo. I want to do something a lot like this but I will have many cards, each one of them should be able to expand it's own "sub-content" at will. The demo shows a single button tied to a single TelerikAnimationContainer. What is the best solution to have 1-n cards, each with their own expandable content that slides out? (mine will slide out to the right, but I don't know that that matters). Thanks, Justin Telerik UI for Blazor 2.29.0

Ok, the Card Overview demo illustrates mostly what I'm looking for with the Comment button on the bottom of each of the cards. There is no animation associated with it, but we can live without that I think.
