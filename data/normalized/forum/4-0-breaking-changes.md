# 4.0 Breaking Changes

## Question

**Luc** asked on 28 Dec 2022

I am performing an upgrade from 2.29 to 3.7. I'm working through some breaking changes listed here regarding grids. During this process, I noticed that we're only a few weeks away from the 4.0 release. Do we know yet what breaking changes might be part of this release and when that info will be posted?

Hello Lucas, A detailed list of all the breaking changes for 4.0 will be out with R1 2023, coming in mid-January. Until then, I cannot provide a complete list of what's changed, but the list includes components like Grid, TreeList, DropDownList, etc. If you want to upgrade to 4.0 soon, then you might consider waiting for the 4.0 release to be out in order to better evaluate the impact of the changes and plan your upgrade strategy accordingly.
