Hi Johan, To know when the Grid has been rendered, you can extract the Grid into a separate razor component and handle the OnAfterRender lifecycle method. Here is an example I have prepared for you: REPL link. Let me know if this is what you are looking for. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
