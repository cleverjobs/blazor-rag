Hello Paul, You can Follow the implementation of a feature that will allow changing the title here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1456950-change-the-title-in-editing-popup.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1456950-change-the-title-in-editing-popup.) I've also added your Vote on your behalf to raise its priority. It also shows a workaround you can consider for the time being. A for the validation messages - can you reproduce such a problem in this demo or with the code from this article? It seems to work fine for me and perhaps there is some project-specific CSS rule interfering. Regards, Marin Bratanov
