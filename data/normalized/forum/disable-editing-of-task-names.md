# Disable editing of task names

## Question

**Iva** asked on 08 Nov 2021

Can I turn off editing of task names? I plan to create a list of tasks with fixed names, but when I click on the name cell, the editing mode is activated. And in general, is it possible to disable the built-in edit form and override your own by clicking the edit button in the command column? The proposed editing functionality is not convenient.

Hello Ivan, I have opened a feature request on your behalf: Add the OnEdit event to the Gantt. This event would allow you to cancel the edit of certain tasks based on a condition.
