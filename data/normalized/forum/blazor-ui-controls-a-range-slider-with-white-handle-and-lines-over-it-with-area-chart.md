Hi Farukh, I will add the answer from your private ticket in this public post so others can benefit from it: The date range slider from the linked page represents the navigator feature of our Stock Chart component. You can customize the navigator. For more details check the navigator settings section. You may also find the Stock Chart demo helpful. I remain at your disposal if you need further assistance.
