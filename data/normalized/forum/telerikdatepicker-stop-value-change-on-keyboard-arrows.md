Hey, I'm using the TelerikDatePicker in a grid edited row and I want to stop changing values when I click the keyboard arrows. Is there any solution to stop this ? Thanks.

I have a function that allows me to move in a grid with the keyboard arrows, but on the TelerikDatePicker the value changed at the same time as changing rows. Does anyone have an idea to stop the value changing ?
