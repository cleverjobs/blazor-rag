# Grid Clear filter button feature request

## Question

**Ant** asked on 15 May 2024

Could there be an option to NOT close the filter dropdown when the clear button is pressed? I just got a request for this, and their thought is they will have a filter set, then want to click clear and then still pick new items to filter before leaving the dropdown. Also, watching him on a touch device made it also especially painful.

Hi Anthony, The result of our discussion with the team is that keeping the filter dropdown open when the clear button is pressed is a valid feature request. Thus, I created a public item on your behalf to address this: Keep Filter Menu open when the "Clear" button is clicked.
