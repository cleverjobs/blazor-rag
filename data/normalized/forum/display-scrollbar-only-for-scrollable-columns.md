# Display scrollbar _only_ for scrollable columns

## Question

**CJCJ** asked on 28 Apr 2025

I have a grid with first three columns frozen and other columns are horizontally scrollable. Somewhat similar to this example Blazor Grid Columns Frozen (Locked) - Telerik UI for Blazor Is it possible to display the horizontal scrollbar only for the scrollable columns (and do not display for the frozen columns).
