# Returning Values & Text selections from the multiselect

## Question

**Dav** asked on 11 Jun 2021

I need to return separate variables for the selected values (which will be used to query the data) and selected Text that will be use to populate a textbox on the page to show the user what they selected. I have a multiselect embedded within a Telerik Window so it pops-up, they select items and press the select button I have and the pop-up is hidden. it's returning the selected values but how do I also bind to the selected text?
