# TelerikMultiSelect Suggestion List Height

## Question

**Rya** asked on 25 Oct 2023

Is there a way to increase the height/size of the suggestion list for the TelerikMultiSelect control? There does not appear to be a Height property on the control. Thanks.

Hi Ryan, There are some "Popup" settings you can configure for the Telerik Multiselect, which includes Height. Here's a rough example in a REPL if it helps, [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/QRPuQUON21N0cI5f18](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/QRPuQUON21N0cI5f18) Thanks Mark
