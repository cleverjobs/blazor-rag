# Is It possible to revert the indeterminate status to the "old" look (2.26.0)?

## Question

**Max** asked on 24 Nov 2021

Hi, during the previous update, the style of the indeterminate checkbox changed from a square to a thin line. In practice, this is very hard to distinguish from the empty checkbox. Is there a way to revert this to the old style? Kind regards!

Hi Martin, I created a Repl example that changes the loaded icon in indeterminate state to the one with square box inside. [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/cvFvmNbw17ExOCth16](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/cvFvmNbw17ExOCth16) Regards, Joana Progress Telerik

Hi Martin, We are planning a release of a major v5 version of our themes and we will provide a way to easily set icons for the checkbox component. The target time frame for the release is mid January. I am looking for an elegant way to revert the styles to the previously used one, and will update you shortly with my findings. Regards, Joana
