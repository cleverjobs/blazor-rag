# Grid PopupEdit Gridcolumn Colspan

## Question

**Eri** asked on 16 Aug 2022

Hey, I am trying to format the popup edit modal that is displayed when I set the EditMode="GridEditMode.Popup". I see that I can define the number of columns used by setting the GridSetting.GridPopupEditFormSettings.Columns property, but is there a way to span a GridColumn accross multiple columns? As an example, i am attempting to make my edit form look like this where some GridColumns span multiple columns in the popup.

Hi Eric, Such advanced customization will require a completely custom Grid popup edit form. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
