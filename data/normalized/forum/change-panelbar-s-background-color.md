# Change PanelBar's background color

## Question

**Sof** asked on 21 Aug 2023

I am using the TelerikPanelBar with only 1 item to create a collapsible form. Is it possible to control the color and background color of the HeaderTemplate. <TelerikPanelBar Data="@Model" ExpandedItems="@Model"> <PanelBarBindings> <PanelBarBinding> <HeaderTemplate> <h4>Filters</h4> </HeaderTemplate> </PanelBarBinding> </PanelBarBindings> </TelerikPanelBar>

Hi Software, From my understanding, your objective is to change the color of headers within a PanelBar configuration that incorporates a HeaderTemplate. To address this scenario, I have prepared an illustrative example for you within this REPL link. It showcases the needed CSS selectors for attaining the intended outcome. I've included comments alongside each selector for guidance. I encourage you to run and test the example to observe the outcome firsthand. As a next step, feel free to adjust the colors to align with your specific scenario requirements. Let me know if this approach aligns with your expectations or if there are any additional aspects I should address. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
