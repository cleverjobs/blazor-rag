# RadDiagram for Blazor?

## Question

**Tay** asked on 22 Jun 2022

Are there any plans to bring the RadDiagram over to Blazor? I would purchase today if that was out. I have medium-term plans to move my WPF app over to the web using Blazor, and I love the RadDiagram in WPF so much that I really don't want to use another company's controls for something so pivotal to the application.

Hi Taylor, I see you also posted this question in the public feature request for a Diagram component. I will directly follow up with an update there, so any other interested parties are informed, too. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva
