# Avoid white border when click into tabstrip content

## Question

**Twa** asked on 04 Aug 2023

Hello everyone, I'm working with tabstrips, and I've noticed that when clicking on the tab content, a white border appears (see left side of the image). I've tried several styles, but I haven't been able to remove it. How can I make that border not visible? Thank you. Twain.
