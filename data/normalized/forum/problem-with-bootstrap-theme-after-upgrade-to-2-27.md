# Problem with bootstrap theme after upgrade to 2.27

## Question

**Die** asked on 25 Nov 2021

Hi, after I've upgraded my project to 2.27, my controls are not aligned anymore. I've found out the issue is at the all.css file, where it defines the height of the input controls, as shown in the files. Is there anything I can to do fix it?
