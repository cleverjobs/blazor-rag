# Reorder tiles programmatically or with keyboard

## Question

**Mik** asked on 14 Nov 2024

Is there a way to programmatically reorder the tiles in a tile layout? For accessibility, I'd like to provide an alternative method for a user to use the keyboard to reorder the tiles instead of just drag and drop. Your documentation provides an example to do this with resizing of the tiles, but not reordering.
