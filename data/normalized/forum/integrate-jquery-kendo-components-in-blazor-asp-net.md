Hello Sami, We also have a documentation article about using Kendo UI jQuery in Blazor apps. Note that it is completely possible to integrate Kendo UI in Blazor, but we don't support such integration. If you have questions about the jQuery widgets themselves, then we can handle them as part of the Kendo UI jQuery support. Regards, Dimo
