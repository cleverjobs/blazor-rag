# OnFocus event for DropDownList?

We'd like to open the dropdownlist automatically when it receives focus, and then focus on the filter textbox inside the dropdown. Is this possible? Was hoping for an OnFocus event.

Hello James, The DropDownList opens automatically on click event. Since you want to open it when it receives focus, you need to use JavaScript. You can check our Knowledge Base article how to open the DropDownList on focus. If your UI for Blazor version is 3.5.0. or later, I am additionally sending a REPL example on how to invoke a method, instead of simulate key events. Open the example and tab to focus the DropDownList. I want to use the case to thank you for this question, because I noticed that the KB article is outdated, for which I logged a task to update it.
