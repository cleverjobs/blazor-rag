# When bunit testing a form containing a TextArea that is hidden after submit, I get a Bunit.JSRuntimeUnhandledInvocationException

## Question

**Ste** asked on 12 Feb 2021

I have a EditForm containing a TelerikTextArea wrapped in an if statement that will hide the test area after submit. This works find in browser, but using bunit I get an exception. I assume this is due to the JS library not being loaded. Do you know how to fix this?

Hi Steven, Can you confirm you have working IJSRuntime injected (mocked with tools like JustMock or Moq, not the one that comes with bUnit), as explained here [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/testing?](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/testing?)

I literally just figured it out. I miss read some bunit docs that made is sound like IJsRuntime was auto injected. All good now thanks!
