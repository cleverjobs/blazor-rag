Hi Minji, We have an open feature request to enhance the default behavior of the ContextMenu component, specifically to prevent it from closing when an item is clicked, allowing it to remain open. To track this enhancement request, please refer to the following public item: " Do not close Context Menu on parent item click ". You can vote for the item to raise the priority. Additionally, subscribing to it will ensure that you receive email notifications for any updates on its progress. In the meantime, If any viable alternatives arise, I will promptly share them as comments in the aforementioned item. Regards, Hristian Stefanov
