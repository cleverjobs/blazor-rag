# Upload dropzone not working after update to 4.01

## Question

**RobRob** asked on 13 Feb 2023

I believe this broke with the 4.01 changes? I can no longer drop a file on the upload button, it just does the default "open file with browser" action.

It is 4.01. I updated the REPL in this answer from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1, and it went from working to not working. [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wduQPzGl08ReuqHl49](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wduQPzGl08ReuqHl49)

Hello Rob, As part of our 4.0 release, we introduced some rendering changes for the components to unify their rendering. I am sending a modified version of the REPL link where the changes are taken into account and the Upload works as expected. Can you confirm that? Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
