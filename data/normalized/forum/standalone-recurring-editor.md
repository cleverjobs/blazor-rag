# Standalone Recurring Editor

## Question

**Ric** asked on 20 Feb 2025

Is there a way to use the recurrence editor without using the scheduler. I want to utilize the editor during configuration of auto-replenishing inventory. For example, hourly tickets for an event. For this I want to use the recurrence editor as a type of rule configurator instead of a full scheduler.

Hi Ricky, Officially - no. Unofficially - yes, but this is strictly not supported at this point. The related feature request has gained enough popularity, so we may work on it in 2025. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
