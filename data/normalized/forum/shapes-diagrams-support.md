# Shapes/Diagrams Support?

## Question

**Bre** asked on 27 Jun 2022

I need to draw a number of shapes (rectangles connected lines, like org charts, but not an org chart) and let users interact with them with Telerik Blazor handling all other UI. Are there any plans to have diagrams functionality like the Kendo UI jQuery Diagrams?

Hi Brett, Yes, we do have plans for releasing Diagram for Blazor. Here is the public request that you can follow so you receive email updates for the progress of the component: Diagram like Kendo UI I already added your vote there since thus we keep track of the community demand. For the time being, you may try using the Kendo Diagram widget in a native Blazor application as suggested in the public thread. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva Progress Telerik
