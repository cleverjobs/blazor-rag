# Map Component Question

## Question

**Jos** asked on 01 Nov 2023

Hello, Quick question regarding the map component. I'm looking to use the map component for some map based charting purposes and was wondering if the opacity style value for the shape can somehow be bound to a data element allowing for the opacity to change based upon the data value assigned to a shape (ie: Pennsylvania data point is 5000 so its opacity would be .8, Ohio data point is 4000 so its opacity would be .65, etc.). Or is there an easier way to do something like this that i'm missing? Thanks Josh F.

Hi Josh, Currently the only way to achieve different opacities (or colors) is to separate the shapes to multiple layers. We have a feature request about data-driven Map shape colors. I encourage you to upvote and follow it, and also, describe your use case there, so that we can consider it together with the multiple color support. (In other words, share why do you need different opacities, rather than different colors).
