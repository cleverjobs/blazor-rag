# Grid paging issue

## Question

**Oli** asked on 24 Sep 2024

Hi, I am encountering an issue with the Telerik Grid in our Blazor project. Specifically, when there is only one record on the second page of the grid, and I delete that record, the grid does not automatically jump back to the first page, even after refreshing the grid. Steps to Reproduce: Navigate to a grid with multiple pages. Ensure there is only one record on the second page. Delete that record. Observe that the grid does not return to the first page I would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue or if there are any workarounds you could recommend. Thank you for your assistance!
