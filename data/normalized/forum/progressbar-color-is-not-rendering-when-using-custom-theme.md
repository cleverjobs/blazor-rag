Since 4.0.0 version, the proposed CSS customization is not working with custom Saas Theme Buider again. Progress color does't rendering. Please update ThemeBuilder.

Hi all, This topic was initially raised in the following forum thread, so I posted a comment there: [https://www.telerik.com/forums/how-to-conditionally-format-the-color-of-the-progress-bar](https://www.telerik.com/forums/how-to-conditionally-format-the-color-of-the-progress-bar) In summary, the new ThemeBuilder version release is planned for today. You may then try generating your custom theme anew. Also, we are working on a solution to publish a new ThemeBuilder release together with each product release. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva
