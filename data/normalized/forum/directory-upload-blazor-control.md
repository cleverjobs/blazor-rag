# Directory upload blazor control

## Question

**Mat** asked on 27 Apr 2021

In the Blazor upload control, is there a way to upload directories? In MVC, its just .Directory(true) .DirectoryDrop(true) Blazor Upload does not have any similar, properites. Was that functionality not ported over?

Hello Matthew, I made this page where you can Follow the implementation of folder upload in Blazor: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1517251-directory-upload.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1517251-directory-upload.) We do not port or wrap jQuery widgets, we create native Blazor components from the ground up, and thus it may take some time to get all the features in a 2 year old suite that you might be used to in a decade (or more) old suite.
