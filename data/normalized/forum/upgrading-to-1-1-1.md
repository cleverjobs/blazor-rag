I don't see the new release 1.1.1 in the telerik nuget feed, do I need to do something special?

Hi Kenny, Try downloading it from your account by following these steps: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/installation/zip.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/installation/zip.) After downloading it, you could check the online feed again and if it doesn't show up - set up a local one as explained in the article. Regards, Marin Bratanov
