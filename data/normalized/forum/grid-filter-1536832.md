Hi, We have the OnRead event for that. You can read more about what it does and how to use it here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/manual-operations.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/manual-operations.) There are also full blown samples for server filtering through HTTP calls in these sample projects: [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/datasourcerequest-on-server](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/datasourcerequest-on-server) Regards, Marin Bratanov
