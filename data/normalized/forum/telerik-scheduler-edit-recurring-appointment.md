# Telerik Scheduler "Edit Recurring Appointment"

## Question

**Ran** asked on 20 Jan 2025

Do we have the ability to differentiate which button is clicked on the Edit Recurring Appointment window? I'm using a custom edit form, but I don't know if there is a way to tell which button is selected on this window. The default form can differentiate the button chosen but I do not find anything in the args that tells me the selection. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Ranndy, A feature request for the desired functionality has already been submitted on our public feedback portal: Differentiate "edit current occurrence" and "edit the series" in the RecurrenceDialog. I voted for the item on your behalf and raised its priority. You can also subscribe to it to receive email notifications for future status updates. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
