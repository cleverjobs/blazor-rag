# TOOLTIPS

## Question

**Alb** asked on 23 Sep 2019

Hi, I need to add tooltips to charts. Is this feature comming soon? p.e i have a chart that shows filename usage but the same filename can be used in multiple folders and there is no way to differentiate in this case i would like to add a tooltip to show the full path to the file when hover on the filename not just the name like in the attached screenshot.

You should check out ChartSeriesLabels. You can define a template for a series. [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/chart/labels-template-and-format](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/chart/labels-template-and-format)

To add to that, Alberto, you can Follow the progress of a tooltips feature in this page (I added your vote already): [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1412734-tooltips-for-series-data-points.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1412734-tooltips-for-series-data-points.) We have this in our sights and it will get implemented. At the moment we are focusing on some other high-impact components (see the roadmap ) and what the chart will get for our next release is three new chart types - bubble, scatter and scatter line.
