# Chip Component for Blazor

## Question

**Fed** asked on 02 Nov 2022

Hello, Are you planning on building a single Chip component for Blazor? Is there an existing component that could achieve something like the screenshot attached? That is an absolute-positioned chip to be displayed over the original card element.

Hi Federico, In the Telerik products context, such a component is called Badge. It is not currently available in UI for Blazor, however, it will be exposed in a future version of the product: Badge component. I added your vote to the request - we track the gathered community votes to prioritize the upcoming components and their enhancements. Additionally, you may subscribe for the public item to get status updates - this is the best way to follow its progress. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva Progress Telerik
