Sass ThemeBuilder: import of this SASS file 3. SELECTED COMPONENTS - only "Grid" 3. some changes / color corrections 4. download=> it throws an exception (see the attachment below) Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Hello Zoya, Currently, the Theme Builder needs some internal improvements to better recognize custom themes, not generated from the tool. I have created a demo theme (using our Theme Builder) - an attached file, which you can use as a base and further customize it using the tool. The colors are based on the Darkly theme you sent. I hope this helps you move forward with your application. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
