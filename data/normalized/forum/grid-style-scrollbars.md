Hi Hendrik, I noticed that you already have a question in the forum about the Grid scrollbar styling: Grid: Auto-Hide vertical Scrollbar. Let's keep the conversation there to keep the portal clean and tidy. Regards, Hristian Stefanov

I this question I asked for the styling of the Scrollbar. It is always grey, even if I use the Thembuilder Pro. I want to give it a nicer look to my Main-Theme.

Hi Hendrik, The Grid uses the default browser scrollbar. To customize it, you may target the separate elements of the ::-webkit-scrollbar and style them as needed. You may find the list of selectors here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar.) I hope this helps. Please let us know if any other questions appear. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva
