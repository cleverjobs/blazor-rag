# Looking for case studies using Blazor in customer-facing apps

## Question

**Bit** asked on 17 Dec 2020

Anyone got a list of a few case studies of web apps that have been deployed "into the wild" - especially if using the Kendo library? So far, I have built just one but it is an internal (behind the firewall) app and it is working great.

Hi, Since this was posted in the UI for Blazor forum (and the Telerik UI for Blazor components are native, they are not wrappers over the Kendo widgets), I will start with information we have on that - currently, we have several testimonials, yet we have not received case studies yet (although we'd like to, if you want yours published, let me know). As for the Kendo jQuery widgets - you can find some on their case studies page and testimonials page. Regards, Marin Bratanov
