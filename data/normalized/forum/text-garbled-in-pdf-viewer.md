# Text garbled in pdf viewer

## Question

**RobRob** asked on 09 Dec 2022

I'm trying out the TelerikPdfViewer component in my Net7 Blazor Wasm project, but text PDFs open up with text that has missing parts. Sample: If I change the scale and change back using the zoom in/out buttons, the problem is fixed. But the garbled text appears at each first viewing for all scale stops. I get this in Chrome and in Edge, browser scaling at 100%, desktop scaling at 100% but alternate scaling for both also still have the same issue.
