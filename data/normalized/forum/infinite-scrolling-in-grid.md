# Infinite scrolling in grid

## Question

**And** asked on 14 Jun 2023

Is it possible to perform infinite scrolling in the grid, where the data is pulled from an external API as the user scrolls? If so, is there a sample I could use?

Check out Blazor Grid - Virtual Scrolling

It has been a while but is there anyone that has accomplished this without virtual scrolling? The virtualisation doesn't support rows with variable row heights which is one of our requirements and pagination is less than optimal for our requirements and design. Without writing our own JS triggers for the OnRead when he hit a certain element has telerik got any built in solutions? I havnt come across any yet.
