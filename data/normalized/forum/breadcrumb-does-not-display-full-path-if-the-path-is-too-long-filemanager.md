# Breadcrumb does not display full path if the path is too long FileManager

## Question

**Tas** asked on 16 Apr 2025

Hi Team, Breadcrumb does not display full path if the path is too long FileManager For eg.: My path is "C:/AppName/Storage/ FileStorage/New folder/New folder/New folder/New folder/New folder " But breadcrumb only displays: "C:/AppName/Storage/ FileStorage/New folder/New folder/New folder" Is it because there is no space to show the complete path? I have debug my code and checked, the path of FileManager is correct. What may be the issue here?

No still facing the same issue. This is mostly occurring with you have nested folders with same name.
