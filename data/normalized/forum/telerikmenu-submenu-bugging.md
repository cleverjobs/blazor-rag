# TelerikMenu Submenu bugging

## Question

**Nik** asked on 03 Dec 2021

Hello, I have a telerik menu, with a submenu in it. How do I stop the primary menu from closing, when dragging the mouse out of the submenu in the "wrong" position? Or is it possible to align the submenu to the left of the primary menu? Its a bit hard some times to reach all menu items below the submenu trigger, when the primary menu keeps closing.

Hi Nikolas, Thank you for the provided video! I understand your desire to keep the child menu visible a bit longer. Currently our menu component does not support this option, thus I apologize for any inconvenience you have. There is already a feature request for such functionality. It is already pretty popular, so I believe we will include it in our to-do list the next time we plan Menu enhancements. My suggestion is to vote for it and follow it to receive notifications for future updates. Regards, Apostolos
