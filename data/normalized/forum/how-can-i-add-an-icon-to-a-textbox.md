Hi Kelly, I made the following article that showcases a couple of approaches to do that: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/textbox-add-icon](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/textbox-add-icon) Regards, Marin Bratanov

The above article does not appear to work anymore with the current release of Telerik Blazor (v3.3). It would be nice if the team could add "Icon" and "IconClass" parameters to the TelerikTextBox control to abstract the implementation details for this, like many of the other Blazor controls already have.
