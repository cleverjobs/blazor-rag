# Grid Filter not Refreshing

## Question

**Vis** asked on 06 Sep 2021

Hi, I have a column and collection with different values and if I add the new value or remove the value, the filter is not refreshing. How can I have the refresh? Could you please guide on this. Thanks, Vishnu Vardhanan

Hi Vishnu I think this is the same question as before? As long as it is an ObservableCollection, this should work automatically.
