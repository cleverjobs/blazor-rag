my rough workaround is this styling: .k-animation-container { margin-top: -5px; margin-left: -5px; padding: 5px; }

Hello Brent, You can Follow the status of this issue here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1428679-popups-like-filter-menu-dropdownlist-do-not-have-a-border-shadow-in-material-theme.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1428679-popups-like-filter-menu-dropdownlist-do-not-have-a-border-shadow-in-material-theme.) The page used to have a more concrete title but I updated it to be broader - this affects other popups like the filter menu in the grid too. In it, you can also find another workaround that may be a little better so you can give it a shot. Regards, Marin Bratanov
