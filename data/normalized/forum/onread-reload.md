# OnRead reload

## Question

**HYO** asked on 01 Dec 2021

Hello, Excuse the bad English There is a telerik grid on the razor page. I want to reload the telerik grid whenever the parameter value changes that has changed the this razor file. I tried reloading sourcedata using OnParametersSetAsync() method, but I didn't reload ReadItems() which is running on OnRead event. How do I reload the Read Items() method?
