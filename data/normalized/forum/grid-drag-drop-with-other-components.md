# Grid: Drag & Drop with other Components

## Question

**Hen** asked on 01 Jul 2024

Is it possible to drag a row a custom component and raise an event ?

## Answer

Hello Hendrik, I confirm that the Grid supports row dragging only to a specific number of Telerik components. For integration scenarios with other custom components, I recommend using Grid row selection and buttons instead of dragging. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik

Thank your for your answer. It would be nice to have a special Telerik-Component in the future that works like a generic Dropzone like a special DIV that can be used inside other components. I need that kind of feature very much...
