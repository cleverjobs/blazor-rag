# How to localize currency using numerictextbox for blazor

## Question

**EdEd** asked on 29 Jun 2022

I need to be able to display currency formatted to the users locale. My app is hosted on a machine in the U.S. but the users are in the UK. I need to have Â£ for the UK and $ for the U.S. A point in the right directly would be great! Thanks ... Ed

Hello Ed, There are two different approaches you can take to achieve the desired behavior: You can implement a Globalization dropdown in your application like in our Globalization demos. If you change the language from the DropDown you will see that the currency denominator will change accordingly. Use a WASM application. The server-side Blazor application takes the current culture of the server that hosts the application. So if you host the application in the US, the currency sign will be USD ($). If you are using a WASM application, it will automatically take the culture from the client's machine and apply the correct currency sign. Let me know if this helps you move forward.
