Hello Martin, To each question in its distinct turn: How can I set a column header for my hierarchical data? My best guess is that you want to add a column header in the main Grid for your details template. If that is the case, you can maybe utilize the MultiColumnHeaders. If this is not what you require, expand a bit the use-case with some details. Also when there is no hierarchical data the “+” and the template should not be rendered. You can see the Conditional Grid ToolBar and DetailTemplate knowledge-based article to see more information and snippets on this topic. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
