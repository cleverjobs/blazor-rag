# Custom FilterMenuTemplate - can I add extra buttons?

## Question

**Adr** asked on 02 Jun 2021

I have created my own custom FilterMenuTemplate which is working. I get the standard "Clear" and "Filter" buttons in the filter popup for free. I would like to add a third custom button next to the "Clear" and "Filter" buttons called "Default" (see red outline on attached image as to where I would like to place the button). Looks like it would need to be placed inside the <div class=" k-columnmenu-actions"> Clicking on the "Default" button will reset the filter back to the default values e.g. "C0", "UA" and "BM" - is that possible?

Hi Adrian, The customizable part of the filter menu popup is above the two built-in buttons. I hope that it will be acceptable for you to place the "Reset to Default" button there. Perhaps if the button is expanded to 100% width, it will look more natural. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
