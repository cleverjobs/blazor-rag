Hi Shah, Our Grid component uses TelerikNumericTextBox internally to render numeric fields. A feature request for the desired functionality has already been submitted on our public feedback portal: " Allow formatted numbers (e.g., 1,234,567.89) to be pasted into a NumericTextBox. " You can vote for this item to increase its priority and subscribe to receive email notifications for updates on its status. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
