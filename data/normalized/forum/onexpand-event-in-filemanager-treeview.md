# OnExpand event in FileManager treeview

## Question

**n/an/a** asked on 27 Jun 2022

Hi, there's any chance to use OnExpand treeview event inside filemanager to refresh treeview subdir of the expanding folder? My file system contain tons of files and subfolder for dozens of hyerarchical subfolders. The example present in your demo that preload hyerarchical subfolders inside Data isn't a solution for me.

Hello Marco, I think the OnExpand event for the TreeView in the FileManager is a good enhancement for the component. I have added a new feature request on your behalf - Add the OnExpand and OnCollapse events for the TreeView segment. I have added your Vote for it and you are automatically subscribed to receive email notifications on status updates. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
