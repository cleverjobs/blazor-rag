# 0.1.0 feedback

## Question

**Alb** asked on 22 Jan 2019

Congrats on the early preview release, I am glad to see this and you made a great choice releasing this way even with just 2 components! I plan to start working in small blazor project and Grid and TabStrip are things I always use. Other component that I always use and would be nice to see next is Window for filling/editing forms and doing multi-steps wizards using window + tabstrip components. Also would be nice to see combobox/notification/dialog components and some basic charts like pie or donut, line and bar charts. In term of licensing I have Kendo UIÂ® + ASP.NET (MVC & Core), PHP, JSP subscription/bundle, will this be included as part of it or it will require a different license?

Hello Alberto, Thank you for sharing your feedback about the preview version of Blazor, we highly appreciate that. As we pointed in the following blog post, we will extend the number of components based on our customers feedback to fulfill your needs and help you build beautiful apps for shorter time: [https://www.telerik.com/blogs/introducing-the-telerik-ui-for-blazor-early-preview](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/introducing-the-telerik-ui-for-blazor-early-preview) Having said that, I am happy to let you know that ComboBox and Window components, along with some Chart types and additional Grid features are in our current plan for 2019. Regarding Navigation and Dialog components, we will take those into consideration for the roadmap and see what we can deliver over the next couple of versions. In terms of licensing it is too early to say how we will distribute Telerik UI for Blazor, as the framework is still experimental. However, you can keep an eye on our blogs for any news on this subject. Regards, Pavlina
