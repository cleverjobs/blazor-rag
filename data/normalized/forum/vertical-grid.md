# Vertical Grid

## Question

**Bri** asked on 03 Sep 2024

I used to use Syncfusion Grid for blazor. It had an option to automatically draw the columns vertically. So your column row would be on the left and 1 row of data would be on the right. How can I do this with Telerik Blazor Grid? Is it even possible?

Hi Brian, This is the so-called transposed Grid. People sometimes refer to it as "horizontal Grid" or "vertical Grid", depending on their point of view. In any case, I must confirm that we don't support it at this point. Here is a KB article with possible workarounds: Transposed Blazor Grid Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
