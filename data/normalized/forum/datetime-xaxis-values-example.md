# DateTime XAxis Values Example

## Question

**Bri** asked on 30 Jan 2020

I'm trying to graph some events (Y) over time (X). ScatterLine chart or anything really. I've put a DateTime field in the XField value, but the results look like the number of seconds since the epoch. A) Can any of the charts handle DateTime values? B) If yes, does anyone have a good example to share?
