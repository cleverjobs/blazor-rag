## Question

**Hen** asked on 01 Oct 2022

What is the best way to implement a Clear-Button in a TextBox like in the ComboBox ? I need it especially for a custom Filterrow in the GridControl.

Hello Hendrik, You can use a combination of the TelerikTextBox and the TelerikButton with just an Icon (without text) and apply some CSS to make them look like the ComboBox's input. This would be the best way for you to move forward. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov Progress Telerik
