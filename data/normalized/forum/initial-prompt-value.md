The default dialogs are nice. Is there a way to populate the prompted value with a default value in Dialogs.PromptAsync?

Hello John, We have two open feature requests that might be interesting for you: The addition of a fully-fledged Dialog would allow you to customize each part of the component DefaultText parameter for the Prompt Dialog - you can also see a workaround in the public thread. If you are interested in either (or both) feature getting implemented I would suggest you Vote for them and Follow the public threads to receive email notifications on status updates. Let me know if you need any further information or any other questions. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
