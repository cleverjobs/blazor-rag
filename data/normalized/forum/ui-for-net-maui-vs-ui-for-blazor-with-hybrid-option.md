# UI for .NET MAUI vs UI for Blazor (with Hybrid option)

## Question

**And** asked on 01 Jun 2024

I dont' understand why I need to buy "UI for .NET MAUI", if I have already "UI for Blazor"? Could you me explain ? With Hybrid option I can creare Windows, MAC, Ios and Android, using only "UI for Blazor". Thanks. Andrea

Hi Andrea, The answer to that depends on what kind of components you want to use in your MAUI app. If you want to use the UI for Blazor components, you can do that with your existing license for UI for Blazor. Here you can find information on how to set them up: First Steps with Blazor Hybrid. If, however, you want to use the.NET MAUI controls (this is a separate product) you will need an additional license for that. I hope this provides more clarity on the matter.
