Hi Is there a method or trick to write my own texts (events) in the Calender? I would like it to be something like the attached picture.

Hello Jesper, That's the MonthView of the scheduler, I think: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/scheduler/month-view](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/scheduler/month-view) If you do want to hack the calendar to show so much data, considering its design is to be relatively tiny, the day templates would let you do that: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1446960-add-day-cell-customisation-templates-to-the-calendar.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1446960-add-day-cell-customisation-templates-to-the-calendar.) You can Follow the implementation of this feature there, and I've added your Vote to raise its priority. You can Vote for items you find useful yourself too. Regards, Marin Bratanov

The best way to know that is to click the Follow button on the feature request page. Once we know the release a feature/fix will be in, we update that page so everyone who follows it will get an email. In the meantime, I'd encourage you to give the scheduler month view a try, the appointments have templates so you can control what they render. Regards, Marin Bratanov
