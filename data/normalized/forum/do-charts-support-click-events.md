# Do charts support click events?

## Question

**Adr** asked on 03 Jul 2019

Is it possible to add on click handlers to the chart data series and in the click event args get access to the data point that was clicked? I'd like to be able to add some 'drill-down' functionality in order to display further more detailed info after the user clicks on a particular data point in the chart, e.g. a specific pie segment for bar/column etc?
