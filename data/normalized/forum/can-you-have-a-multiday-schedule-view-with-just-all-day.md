# Can you have a MultiDay Schedule view with just "all day"?

## Question

**Bra** asked on 04 Oct 2021

I would like to use the Scheduler for visualizing resource scheduling by day. Each row would be a resource and each column a day. Is there a way to turn off the hours and hide the column with "all day" and the hours in it? Thanks, Brad

Hi Bradley, I think you should use a grid for that where you can make a row for each resource and columns for the days you want there. The scheduler is not designed for this. Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
