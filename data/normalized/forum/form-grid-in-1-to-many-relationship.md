# Form / Grid in 1-to-Many relationship

## Question

**Isa** asked on 19 May 2022

Dear All, I am currently trying to create a Blazor Application. If I had a list of records in a Grid, I would like to click a button to open a Form. Let us say that this form is a Customer Address (parent). Once this form is opened, I would like to see a Grid that contains the Orders (child). I can create class models for both Address/Orders. I will migrate them to an RDBMS like SQL Server. Does anyone know if Telerik has sample application like this or if you know any link that you can point me to? I have recently purchased a license for Telerik, and so far, I like what I see. Your response to the above request is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Isaiah A

Hi Isaiah, I have noticed that the current thread is a duplicate of a ticket from our private support system, therefore, I am pasting the answer here: Indeed, the Telerik UI Grid for Blazor exposes the option to edit the items in an external form. Check out our form editing demo. Alternatively, our Popup editing mode features such a form, however, it is inside a Window element. Check out the Popup editing demo. In case any additional clarifications are needed, I recommend that we continue the discussion in the other thread of yours. Kind regards, Tsvetomir Progress Telerik
