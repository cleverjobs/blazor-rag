# WPF Binding Converters equivalent in Telerik Blazor?

## Question

**Adr** asked on 17 Jun 2021

I have a .NET Framework WPF Silverlight app which I am converting across to .NET Core Blazor WebAssembly. The existing app heavily uses binding converters (that implement System.Windows.Data.IValueConverter) throughout the UI codebase. The <telerik:Rad* controls make use of these converters. Is there an equivalent to this for the Telerik Blazor controls? N.B. Some of the converters are used in two-way binding. Some examples of these existing converters: Imports System.Windows.Data Public Class DecimalZeroBlankConverter Implements IValueConverter Public Function Convert(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.Convert If value Is Nothing Then Return Nothing End If If value=0 Then Return Nothing End If Dim dec As Decimal=value Return dec.ToString( "###,###,##0.00" ) End Function Public Function ConvertBack(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.ConvertBack Throw New NotImplementedException End Function End Class Imports System.Windows.Data Public Class PercentageConverter Implements IValueConverter Public Function Convert(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.Convert If value Is Nothing Then Return 0 End If Return value * 100 End Function Public Function ConvertBack(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.ConvertBack If value Is Nothing Then Return 0 End If If String.IsNullOrEmpty(value) Then Return 0 End If Return value / 100 End Function End Class Imports System.Windows.Data Public Class YesNoVisibilityConverter Implements IValueConverter Public Function Convert(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.Convert If value Is Nothing Then Return Visibility.Collapsed End If If value="Y" Then Return Visibility.Visible Else Return Visibility.Collapsed End If End Function Public Function ConvertBack(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.ConvertBack Throw New NotImplementedException End Function End Class Imports System.Windows.Data Public Class BooleanFontWeightConverter Implements IValueConverter Public Function Convert(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.Convert If value Then Return FontWeights.Bold Else Return FontWeights.Normal End If End Function Public Function ConvertBack(value As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements IValueConverter.ConvertBack Throw New NotImplementedException End Function End Class

Hello Adrian, It seems that Value converters are supported for Blazor. You can find more information on the topic from the Blazor (client): Support value converters or similar for binding GitHub issue in Microsoft's ASP Net Core repository. Let us know if you need any further assistance! Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov Progress Telerik
