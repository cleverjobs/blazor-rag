# TelerikGrid Resizable columns: Last column

## Question

**Ric** asked on 20 Jun 2023

The Resizable attribute o TelerikGrid is very useful, but it would be better if the last column's width could stretch to fit its container, whenever we resize other columns that make the former move from its previous position, like shown in the picture. Is there a way to that automatic resize of the last column?

Hi Ricardo, Resizing the columns works by setting concrete values for its columns and the main grid table in pixels, so there is no direct way to make the last column automatically expand to fit the space. Regards, Stamo Gochev
