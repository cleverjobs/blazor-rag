## Question

I'm looking for an image carousel with both scroll and zoom features. Is that possible with the Telerik carousel?

Hi Celeste, If you have a component that will provide the desired image capabilities (zooming on hover, I guess), you can put it in the carousel item template. What the Telerik Carousel does is to give you a template for your content, and to scroll through the items. This lets you define the actual content in any way suitable for your app. Regards, Marin Bratanov
