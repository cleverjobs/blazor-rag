## Question

**Fab** asked on 03 Aug 2023

HI, the DragClueField when using Drag&Drop only exists for the Grid right now. Why is this attribute not setable for the TreeView also?

Hi Fabian, I have already responded to the private support ticket that you submitted earlier. In case any member of our community encounters this thread I am pasting the answer here, also: We do have an open feature request for a Drag clue template, which would come with an OnDrag event where you would be able to validate if the drag and drop action is allowed before the OnDrop event itself. I have added your vote for the item, as it helps us prioritize future feature requests. You can also subscribe to the feature request to get updates on its status. Until the feature is implemented, you can see the Drag and Drop demo to see a sample of how to notify users that certain drop actions are forbidden. To use the demo: Drag a parent node Drop it on any of its children Regards, Georgi Progress Telerik
