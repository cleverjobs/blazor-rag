I have Blazor form that has two combo boxes. The second combo box should be refreshed based on the value selected by user in the first combo box.

Hello Satish, Yes, our documentation includes a knowledge base article Cascading DropDowns. It shows how to implement cascading with all our different dropdown components. You can use it as a reference, to achieve the desirable result. I hope you find the above information useful. Regards, Apostolos

I am getting an error trying to run the demo. I tried both Edge and Chrome browsers.

Hi Satish, There is an integration issue between our documentation and REPL, and unfortunately this causes the error on execution. You can run the example in a local solution or you can check the same example on Telerik REPL. Regards, Apostolos
