Hello, To change the appearance of the Prompt and the Output you can use the AIPrompt Views Templates. I am sending a link to another forum thread, where we have prepared an example for a chat view. The template will also allow further customizations of the output content, including even MarkupString () if necessary, for example, to render a formatted code block. Of course, this may not be completely safe when you don't know what the output will be. On a side note, please ask the license holder at your company to assign you a license, so that your account is compliant with our license agreement. Regards, Nansi Progress Telerik
