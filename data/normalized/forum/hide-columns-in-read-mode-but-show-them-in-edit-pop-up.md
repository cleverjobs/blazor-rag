I have 5 columns but only want to show two of them in reading mode. When create or update I would like a pop-up edit showing all of the fields. How do I accomplished this?

Hi Martin, You can find an example of doing that here, through the grid events and the Visible parameter of the columns: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1466238-show-different-columns-in-the-popup-edit-form-than-are-shown-in-the-grid](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1466238-show-different-columns-in-the-popup-edit-form-than-are-shown-in-the-grid) Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
