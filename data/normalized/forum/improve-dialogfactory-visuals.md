# Improve DialogFactory visuals?

## Question

**RobRob** asked on 20 Jan 2025

The default visuals for the DialogFactory are distractingly different (aka ugly) from my application visuals. Is there any way to modify the predefined dialogs? I think they're a great idea and they do save me time on creating a custom component, but they seem visually inflexible? Rob.

Hi Rob, I can confirm that the Telerik Predefined Dialogs are designed to mimic the browser's alert functionality. For more advanced customization—like handling button click events (canceling, confirming..), adding new buttons, changing backgrounds, etc.—we recommend using our standalone Dialog component as it is designed for that purpose and offers many options.

Hi Hristian, That's what I ended up coding, but I think the objective to providing "canned" dialog defaults should include some visual support otherwise there isn't much point in using them if they just mimic browser's alert. Rob.

Hi Rob, Thank you for your feedback and the update. Our predefined dialogs offer some customization options—you can easily modify the button text, alert content, and title. However, for more advanced customizations, including styling, the standalone Dialog component is the recommended approach. Kind Regards, Hristian
