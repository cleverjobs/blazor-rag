# DropDown Grid

## Question

**Pau** asked on 11 Mar 2022

I am trying to figure out how I can put a Grid in a dropdown panel (essentially a DropDownList, but the dropdown panel contains a full grid rather than just the list). It does not look like DropDownList supports a custom template for the entire dropdown. Is there a Kendo component that could be used to do this?

Hi Paul, At the moment, some custom code is needed for this. You can review this thread for details and sample implementation: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1506370-dropdown-container-popup-component-tied-to-an-anchor-for-positioning.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1506370-dropdown-container-popup-component-tied-to-an-anchor-for-positioning.) This, and a couple of other enhancement requests it links will allow you to have a ready made component for that, so click the Vote and Follow buttons on those that are relevant for you.
