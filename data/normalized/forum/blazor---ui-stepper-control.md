# Blazor - UI Stepper Control

## Question

**JimJim** asked on 11 Jul 2023

The stepper control looks very useful, however the examples are quite limited. I would like to know how I can use a button to change the steps instead of clicking on the stepper control itself. Also, are there any better examples of using validation on each step, such as, when clicking the button to change steps, trigger validation for that step? Thank you, Jim
