Hi Phil, By design, the webkit-scrollbar will appear if the AutoComplete popup height is not enough to display all items. If you want to have a non-scrollable popup, you may adjust its height, so it fits all items. This can be configured through the popup settings. In case you want to keep the scrolling functionality but simply hide the scrollbar, you may target the webkit-scrollbar of the k-list-scroller element and apply styles like the ones listed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16670931/hide-scroll-bar-but-while-still-being-able-to-scroll/38994837#38994837.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16670931/hide-scroll-bar-but-while-still-being-able-to-scroll/38994837#38994837.) In this scenario, I would also recommend setting a custom class to the popup to ensure you are targeting this specific popup element. Here is a runnable sample demonstrating th–µ approach: [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wducvuEX0458Z4Xs14.](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wducvuEX0458Z4Xs14.)
