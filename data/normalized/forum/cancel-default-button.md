# Cancel default button

## Question

**Yur** asked on 01 Apr 2021

I'm testing the confirm dialog. Can I define the Cancel home button by default

Hi Yuri, The browser dialogs also default to the OK/Confirm button and so do ours. At the moment, there isn't a facility to change that in either implementation. How would you expect such a thing to be exposed? Regards, Marin Bratanov

For example, when deleting a line I use Confirm Dialogs, I want the default (active) button to be Cancel (not Ok)
