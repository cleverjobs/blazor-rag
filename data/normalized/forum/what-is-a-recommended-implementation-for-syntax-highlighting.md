# What is a recommended implementation for syntax highlighting

## Question

**EE** asked on 23 Apr 2024

I need to format and highlight xml and json in a view. I can not find a component within Blazor components. In other packages like WinForm there are solutions for displaying code. Any way I'm able to do this without clientside javascript solutions (like PrismJS)? In case there is no component in the Telerik family I can use in Blazor, does anyone have a recommended setup to implement the functionality. A requirement is support for dark/light theming. Thanks for any insights.

Hi E, I confirm that Telerik UI for Blazor doesn't provide a syntax highlighting tool. As far as I know, most such tools are JavaScript-based, with a few exiting C# wrappers. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
