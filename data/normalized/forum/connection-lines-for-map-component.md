# Connection Lines for Map component

## Question

**Ale** asked on 14 Jun 2024

Hi Team, would it be possible to add Connection Lines between markers to the Map component? The items we place on the map are network devices and it would be great, if we could add an array like double[][] to our items to automatically draw a line to this coordinates to show the connections of our network. It could either be an array of coordinates or a list of objects which are already part of the marker layers data. Thank you very much in advance! Best regards, Alexander Schneider

Hello Alexander, We may enable Blazor apps to draw lines on the Map in a future version. You can follow the item to receive status updates (if you haven't already). In the meantime, the only possible option is to use a Map Shape layer and define a very narrow shape between the markers that looks like a line. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
