# Word wrap in drawer

## Question

**NiV** asked on 28 Sep 2024

Good evening. I would like to word wrap the text in the drawer component, this is an example where I would like the wrap (see the first row in which I've added more text to show the ellipses): [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/mSEjwWvZ12HeWVRp26](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/mSEjwWvZ12HeWVRp26) May you kindly help me? Thank you.

Hello, To prevent text from being truncated with ellipses and ensure it wraps within the drawer component, apply the " word-wrap: break-word; " CSS style to the appropriate selector. Iâ€™ve updated the provided REPL sample with this adjustment: REPL link. You can test it and review the new result. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
