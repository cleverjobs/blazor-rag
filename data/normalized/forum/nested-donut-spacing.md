# Nested Donut spacing

## Question

**Wil** asked on 26 Jan 2024

Is there a way to set the spacing between nested donuts? Multiple series. Also, I would like to set the donut section stroke/border. I can do it in xaml but have no clue as to how in html. Actually I haven't much of clue in general since I'm a html/css rookie. Oh the pain... please make it stop. Thanks guys.

In xaml (WINUI) I had to overlay two donuts with transparent chart areas. I suppose I could try that. Assuming I can figure out how to make the background of the chart transparent.
