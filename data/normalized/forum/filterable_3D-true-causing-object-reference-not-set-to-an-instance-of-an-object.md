# Filterable="true" causing Object reference not set to an instance of an object

## Question

**Ale** asked on 10 Jul 2019

Everything is working fine in my Grid, except the Filterable="true". When I set the property to true, the grid throws an exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. at Telerik.Blazor.Components.TelerikRootComponentFragmentBase.OnInitAsync() at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase.RunInitAndSetParametersAsync() Any help?

Hi Alexandre, This exception means that the TelerikRootComponent is not added to the root of the layout as described in the second snippet here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/getting-started/what-you-need#project-configuration.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/getting-started/what-you-need#project-configuration.) For our next version the exception will be more meaningful. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hi Marin I also have similar problem, when I add FilterMode="Telerik.Blazor.GridFilterMode.FilterMenu" parameter to my Grid System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. at Telerik.Blazor.Components.RootComponent.TelerikRootComponentFragmentBase.Dispose() I couldn't understand what the error mean. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Medhanie, This is the first time we get such a report. Can you confirm that you are using the latest version (2.5.1 at the time of writing, and .NET Core 3.1)? If yes, could you open a support ticket and send a runnable sample that showcases this issue so I can investigate? Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hi Marin; Yes I am using latest version but trail one. I'm using Telerik.UI.for.Blezor.Trial (2.5.1) with Core 3.1.0 As you said, I have already created a new ticket, hopping to get some suggestions there. Thank you

NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Telerik.Blazor.Components.Common.Filters.FilterList.TelerikFilterList.GetFilterOperators() I am gtting this on clicking the filter icon in grid. What might be the issue?

Hello Mythri, My best guess is that the type of the field for this column is not supported (see more here ) - e.g., it is a collection of sorts (List, Dictionary), or a complex object (another model). I'd suggest you open a ticket and send us a simple repro we can run and debug - the grid markup and a basic model that shows the problem would usually suffice. Regards, Marin Bratanov
