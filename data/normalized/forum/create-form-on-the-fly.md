# Create form on the fly

## Question

**Pau** asked on 30 May 2022

Hi We have customers who can create there own database table. Currently in Delphi we can create a crud function for this table at run time based on the table definition we store in the database (Fieldname, fieldtype , fieldlength, required field, min value, maxvalue etc..) So now, moving to blazor, we are looking if we can do the same, so the json will have metadata of the formfields that has to be created at run time. The form should show the data in a grid and there is a update form needed to manipulate the data Has someone made this kind of functionality? Eric
