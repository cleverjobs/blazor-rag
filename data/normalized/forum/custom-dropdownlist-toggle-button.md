# Custom DropdownList Toggle Button

## Question

**Bla** asked on 10 Dec 2020

I am looking for a way to change the toggle buttons icon on the TelerikDropdownList. I see in other versions there is a "DropdownButton" available. Is there a way to do that in the Blazor versions current state or is this a feature I need to propose? Thanks.

Hi Blane, You can Follow the implementation of a Split Button component here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1435750-split-button.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1435750-split-button.) The thread also offers a workaround you can use for the time being, and I've added your Vote fore it to raise its priority. If you are looking to change the arrow on the right-hand side of the drodownlist - you can do that with CSS, I've attached an example to the end of this post. Regards, Marin Bratanov
