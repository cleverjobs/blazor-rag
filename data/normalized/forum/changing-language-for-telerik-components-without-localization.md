# Changing language for Telerik components without localization

## Question

**Ric** asked on 21 Feb 2024

Is it possible to change the component's default language without resorting to localization. As of now, I don't really need to customize my app for a specific region and I want to force it to be exclusively in a specific language, in this case Portuguese. By following the tutorial in Blazor Localization - Telerik UI for Blazor I arrive to an annoying problem where dateTime validation triggers format exceptions due to regional formatting of dates.
