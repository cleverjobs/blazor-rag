# Populate cells from object[][]

## Question

**RÃ©m** asked on 21 May 2020

Hi, I don't know how my data are organised, I can't create a class about it (this is CSV file import, any kind of file) I want to display this is a grid. <TelerikGrid Data="@datable.rows" <GridColumns> @{ for ( int i=0; i <datable.columns.Count; i++) { <GridColumn Field="@(i.ToString())"> <Template> @(((QFLib.DataRow)context)[i].ToString()) // How to evaluate i here ? </Template> </GridColumn> } } </GridColumns> </TelerikGrid> It doens't work because the template during code generation doesn't evaluate i Is it possible ? Another way of doing this ? Sincerely, Remi
