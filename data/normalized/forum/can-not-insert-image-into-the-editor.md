# Can not insert image into the editor

## Question

**Oma** asked on 28 Jan 2024

Hello, I'm attempting to add an image to the editor from a different domain. When I insert an image hosted on another domain, it doesn't display (refer to image1). However, if I insert an image hosted on the same wwwroot, it does display (refer to image2). Is this the intended design? Regards, Omar

It seems that only links with HTTPS are allowed. I have added an image that is hosted on another domain with https, and it worked fine. Regards, Omar

Hi Omar, I'm happy to see you quickly resolved the matter on your own. Indeed, only HTTPS links are allowed due to security. Kind Regards, Hristian
