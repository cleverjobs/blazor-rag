## Question

**And** asked on 13 Apr 2020

Hello, I have a bool column in my grid displaying checkboxes. This works fine. In the column header I have filer's drop-down box with text "All", "Is true", "Is false". Is there any way to change this text? I need it be All, Selected, Unselected or something else. Thanks.
