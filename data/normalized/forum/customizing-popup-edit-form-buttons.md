Has this been fixed now? [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1471845-allow-control-over-the-popup-edit-form-buttons-at-the-bottom](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1471845-allow-control-over-the-popup-edit-form-buttons-at-the-bottom) so that we can now change the texts of buttons in Popup form? Thanks.

Hi, To know when a feature gets implemented (like in this case) or an issue fixed, you can click the Follow button on the portal page. This will send you notifications via email when something happens (such as - when we know the release it will be in, we update the page with that information). At the moment, you can already change the texts for all grids in your projects through localization and changing the strings there. In a future version, probably there would be some new feature, even though I can't say exactly what it will be at this point, more information and research are needed for that and they will be done when the item gets enough traction with the community to get into the implementation phase. Right now you can also implement a custom popup form to have full control over layout, data, logic, texts and so on. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hi, Thanks, but can we always be sure that old thread gets updated when there are new information related to them? In this case it is almoast 1,5 years ago since this was last updated.

Yes - all feature requests and bug reports in our Feedback Portal should reflect the actual planning and product state. If there is a mismatch, it should be an accidental oversight. Let us know if you notice such an omission and we will resolve it immediately.
