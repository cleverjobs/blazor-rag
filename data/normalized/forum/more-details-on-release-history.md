# More details on Release History?

## Question

**Cra** asked on 21 May 2025

Hi I was wondering if it's possible to find more details on exactly what is changed in each release? In general the list in Release History is very generic and does not necessarily mention what method or API, etc. changed. Competing products will display links to issues or work items included, or at least more details about what code changes were made. And the lists are comprehensive. For instance, in v9 demos, there is a NEW badge on the Grid -> Export, though exporting has been there for awhile. Reading Release History alludes to: Add configuration for CSV export API Add configuration for Excel export API but that doesn't really tell me what is changed or available now. Looking at the docs nothing seems radically new. Details like that are critical in an enterprise environment when evaluating new features or breaking changes, or to just keep up with what's changing. And if I'm just missing this info somewhere, let me know.

Hello Craig, Thanks for your feedback. It's a good reason to discuss how we can improve our Release notes. We have thought about this in the past, but I am not aware of any specific decisions or plans. With regard to exporting, the new feature is the ability to provide export options to the export methods. See the Grid programmatic Excel Export documentation and example Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
