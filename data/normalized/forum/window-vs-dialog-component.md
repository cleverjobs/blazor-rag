# Window vs Dialog Component

## Question

**Eri** asked on 12 Apr 2024

Can you explain the differences between the Dialog vs the Window Component? And maybe give an example of when you should use one over the other? IN their current form, they seem pretty similar in implementation and functionality if you put aside the predefined dialogs.

Hi Eric, Basically, the Dialog is a modal Window that cannot be resized, dragged, minimized and maximized. The Dialog has built-in layouts for action buttons at the bottom. The Dialog also has the so-called predefined mode, which is similar to browser dialogs. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
