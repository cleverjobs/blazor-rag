# Hybrid AutoGen form and several manual fields?

## Question

**Jst** asked on 29 Dec 2021

In the TelerikForm Blazor control is it possible to have all the fields auto-generate except for a couple of specific ones? I have a form that has ~20 fields on it. It autogenerates properly. I would like to add an additional field for notes but want that to be a multiline text area and I want it to span all the columns of the form. Is there a way to combine an autogenerated form with a few templated forms?

Hi, Once you start using templates or declaring fields manually, the form component can no longer to the automatic generation as conflicts can arise and there isn't a neat way to control what renders where. Thus, I am sorry to say that this is not possible. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Autogeneration could be extended in order to get more FormEditorTypes? For example a ColorPicker input. Or alternatively could I create a "Dynamic Form Builder" to achieve this? Something like this: [https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/how-to-create-a-dynamic-form-builder-in-blazor.aspx](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/how-to-create-a-dynamic-form-builder-in-blazor.aspx) Thank you.

@Jstemper You can customize the automatically generated field by providing the EditorType attribute, exposed on the <FormItem>. Take a look a the example provided in: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/form/overview#customize-the-automatically-generated-fields](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/form/overview#customize-the-automatically-generated-fields) Regards.
