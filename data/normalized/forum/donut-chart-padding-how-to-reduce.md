# Donut chart padding, how to reduce

## Question

**lui** asked on 16 Aug 2022

I'm creating a donut chart using Telerik for Blazor. As you can see from the attached picture, there is a lot of space around the chart, i would like to reduce it to save space, but can't find a way. Many thanks, Luigi

Hi Luigi, You might add a Width parameter to the Chart to specify the space it should use for the drawing. I have created a sample REPL snippet that shows a Donut Chart with Width set to 300px: [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/QwkiFjaI30d1HbLu09](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/QwkiFjaI30d1HbLu09) Regards, Joana
