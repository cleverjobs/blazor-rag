# How to save / restore a filter from the search box?

## Question

**Yur** asked on 03 Jun 2021

My typical case Users for working with various business objects (let's assume that this is a Product) work with a paged grid (the number of pages is from 20 to 1000). Product has 10-30 fields (Name, Type, Code, etc.). The user using the search box selects for example by Type the Product they are interested in and adds the Product with the same Type using a complex form on a separate page. After recording the added Product, the user returns to the page with the paged grid, updates the data, and wants to return to the same search box filter that was before the addition. How do I save the filter from the search box before entering a new Product and restore it after adding a new Product to the database?
