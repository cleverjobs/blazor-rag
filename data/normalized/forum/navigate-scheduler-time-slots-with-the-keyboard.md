# Navigate Scheduler time slots with the keyboard

## Question

**Mik** asked on 19 Feb 2025

Is there a way to navigate the time slots of the scheduler using only the keyboard? The scheduler in the UI for Asp.NET Ajax had this ability. Without this, how does a keyboard only user navigate the scheduler to add new appointments? Thanks, Mike

Hi Mike, The Scheduler in UI for ASP.NET Ajax has a slot selection feature that is currently not available in the Blazor Scheduler component. A feature request for this functionality has already been submitted on our public feedback portal: Drag over the slots to create an appointment in them. Iâ€™ve voted for this request on your behalf and increased its priority. You can also subscribe to the item to receive email updates on its progress. On a side note, I don't see a strong need for navigating between time slots manually, as the recommended shortcut for creating an appointment is " c ", which lets you specify the time slot directly without having to cycle through any empty slots until you find the right one.
