# Programable usage of the Filter Template

## Question

**Cip** asked on 02 Jun 2021

Hi everyone, I have a question regarding the Filter Template. On my grid by default is set the FilterMode to FilterRow and in that situation the row for filter row appears by default on the grid that's fine how it is but I have a setting in my Bussiness Layer, a flag that tells me that the filter should be done down in the SQL select and for that I want to be able to set in the FilterTemplate a an input where the user can enter some values. The FilterTemplate should be set only for the situation explained above otherwise not. Can the FilterTemplate be configured to in use somehow programaticali according to a true/false flag? Thank you, Cipri
