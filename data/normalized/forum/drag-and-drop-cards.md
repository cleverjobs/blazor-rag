Hello Rick, Check the TileLayout component, which provides reordering capabilities. However, in case you need dragging across different groups of items, the TileLayout may not suffice. In this case, I can only suggest to follow this Kanban feature request and consider the Kendo UI based workaround there. Regards, Dimo
