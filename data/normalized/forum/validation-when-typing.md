## Question

Hi, Why does the TelerikTextBox activate the <ValidationSummary /> while typing in the field? Is there a way to disable this behaviour?

Hello Tim, This makes the user experience more fluid and lets the user know about form issues immediately. I made a KB article that explains the situation and offers a solution: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/textbox-validate-on-change](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/textbox-validate-on-change) Regards, Marin Bratanov
