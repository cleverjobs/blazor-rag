# Editor. All Color options

## Question

**Doo** asked on 02 Jun 2021

We have the background and foreground colors available now. But its a few swatch ranges only. I need to have Blue, red, purple, and other colors. Is there still a limitation?

Hi Hassan, Indeed, things remain the same since the last time we have discussed this topic. If you need a custom color palette, you will need to implement a custom Editor tool with the Kendo UI ColorPicker.
