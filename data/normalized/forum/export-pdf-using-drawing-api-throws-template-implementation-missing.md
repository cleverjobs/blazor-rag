# Export PDF using Drawing API throws "Template implementation missing."

## Question

**MaxMax** asked on 10 Jan 2024

I ÃÅm trying to export a page as PDF in a Blazor application. I found this example application that uses the kendo-drawing api with JS interop. [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/pdf-jpg-export-js](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/common/pdf-jpg-export-js) This works fine as long as you do not use a template. The template API is missing entierly. I have for now copied over the entier kendo libs folder from a project that uses kendo MVC. It works, but I would rather just use the kendo-drawing api and not everything. Is the kendo templating stuff available somewhere separately? (NOTE: This is not an accessibility question but there is no tag that fits as far as I can tell and I cannot define a new one)
