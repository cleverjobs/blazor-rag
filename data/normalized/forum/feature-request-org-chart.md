Is there any plan to add a Org Chart as control ? The Org Chart should display the reports to / is manager of relation (1:0,m) between employees and/or managers graphically. It would be great, if this feature request can be added in the near future... Thanks, Christian

Hi Christian, As of the most recent information obtained from our product manager and development team, I confirm that our short-term planning is filled until May, and the item is still not included, which means that it will not be addressed in the next 1-2 months. Frankly, this is currently the information we have for orientation. At this stage, our short-term backlog is addressing issues with higher priority. Rest assured that if I obtain more specific details about this item, I will promptly share them in a comment on the public post to ensure that everyone interested stays well-informed about any developments. Kind Regards, Hristian
