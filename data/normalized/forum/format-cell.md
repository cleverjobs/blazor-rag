# Format cell

## Question

**Pau** asked on 02 Jun 2022

Hi see the image below. The daytimes a person has to work can differ from day by day. We know what times he or she starts/end has breaks. We need to show this (not as real items, just color the cell with a different background color). What we would like to see is an event like "OnDrawColumsCell" with params like day, starttime/endtime, color and text So we can check the day/start/end time to see what color to use and wat text the cell should contain. This way we can show our users exactly their working times. Eric

Eric - this will be possible when these feature requests are implemented - Customize Scheduler Slots Scheduler OnCellRender Event I see that you have already voted to raise the items' priority. For the time being, I am afraid that the Scheduler time slots are out of reach of the component's API.

Hi Lets home it will be done soon, we can not release our software without it. We just moved from DevExpress (where this is possible) to Telerik and we really need this for our customers Is ther no work around ? You color the cells based on start./endtime, so coloring the cells is possible Eric
