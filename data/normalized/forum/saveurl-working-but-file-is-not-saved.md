# SaveURL Working But File is not Saved

## Question

**CS** asked on 27 Feb 2024

I am using a Telerik Upload in one of my project that is currently using Microsoft Azure to host it in the cloud. After a successful submission, my file (which is an image file) should have been saved to my specified location within my project, but it is not. Initially, I thought the submission was successful. However, after using the Developer tools and testing out the file validation methods I found in the Telerik Blazor File Upload demo ( [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upload/overview](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upload/overview) ) in my @code, it is clear to me that the submission was valid. Something else must have been the problem, but I do not know what. Attached is the image for the API endpoint SaveUrl. Thank you in advance!
