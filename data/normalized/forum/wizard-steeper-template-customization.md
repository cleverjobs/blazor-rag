# Wizard steeper template customization.

## Question

**Bla** asked on 27 Jul 2021

Hello. I wanted to know how I can modify the WizardStepper template? Basically I want to customize the WizardStepper in a similar way to when it is customized in the Stepper component ( [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/stepper/step-template](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/stepper/step-template) ). Since the WizardStepper is actually a Stepper, I suppose this is possible. The point is that I have not managed to do it. I'd tried WizardStepperSettings but only two properties can be configured from here (StepType and Linear). Thanks.
