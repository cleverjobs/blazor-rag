## Question

Hello, Is there any way in the Telerik Scheduler for Blazor to get the ExactTimeReadring feature enabled ? Like it is here for example : [https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/scheduler/examples/exacttimerendering/defaultvb.aspx](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/scheduler/examples/exacttimerendering/defaultvb.aspx) Fabien

Hi Fabien, The ExactTimeReadring feature is not yet available in the UI for Blazor Scheduler. We will expose it in a future version of the product. You may follow the public request to get status updates: More precise representation of start/end times on scheduler - Exact Time Rendering I voted for it on your behalf to increase its popularity. We prioritize the enhancements based on the community demand and we keep track of the gathered community votes to evaluate that. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva Progress Telerik
