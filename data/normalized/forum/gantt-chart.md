Hi Jonathan, You can Follow its status here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1419052-gantt-chart.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1419052-gantt-chart.) I've also added your Vote for it. For the time being, you can consider the jQuery Kendo Gantt, you can see an example of using that here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/jquery-kendo-in-blazor](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/jquery-kendo-in-blazor) Regards, Marin Bratanov
