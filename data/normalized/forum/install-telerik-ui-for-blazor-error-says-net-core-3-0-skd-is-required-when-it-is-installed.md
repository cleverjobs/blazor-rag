# install Telerik UI for Blazor, error says .net Core 3.0 SKD is required when it is installed

## Question

**Ton** asked on 17 Apr 2023

I'm trying to install TelerickUI for Blazor, it gets a message that says .net Core 3.0 SKD is required. I have .net Cor3 3.0.103 installed along with 3.1. I restarted Visual Studio, rebooted my computer, but still get this error. How do I install TelerickUI for Blazor? Thanks Error Log:===Verbose logging started: 4/17/2023 9:54:34 Build type: SHIP UNICODE 5.00.10011.00 Calling process: C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Control Panel\ProgressControlPanel.exe===MSI (c) (A8:88) [09:54:34:106]: Resetting cached policy values MSI (c) (A8:88) [09:54:34:106]: Machine policy value 'Debug' is 0 MSI (c) (A8:88) [09:54:34:106]: ******* RunEngine: ******* Product: C:\ProgramData\Progress\Installer\Downloads\telerik.ui.for.blazor.4.1.0.commercial.msi ******* Action: ******* CommandLine: ********** MSI (c) (A8:88) [09:54:34:106]: Client-side and UI is none or basic: Running entire install on the server.

Hi Tony, Thank you for reaching out to us. Based on the provided details, it seems that our standalone installer cannot detect the .NET SDK 3.0 installation. Could you please share with us some more details so as to further investigate the issue on your side, such as: How did you install the .NET Core SDK 3.0 - with Visual Studio or with its standalone installer? Could you please check in the Registry editor (you could launch it directly from the start menu) if .NET 3.0 SDK (or a higher version) is registered under the following node: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\dotnet\Setup\InstalledVersions\x64\sdk - Some screenshots of the values would be highly appreciated. In case the .NET CORE SDK 3.0 (or higher) is not in the list or the dotnet registry node does not exist at all, I would recommend you download its stand-alone installer from the Microsoft download page and try to install it. Could you please perform my suggestion and let us know in case the issue still persists? As a workaround, you could take full advantage of UI for Blazor without installing it with the stand-alone installer but using the hotfix file and our Visual Studio Extensions in a few easy steps: Download and install the Telerik UI for Blazor Visual Studio Extension directly from your Visual Studio: Launch Visual Studio Select Extensions -> Manage Extensions option and expand the Online tab Type " Telerik UI for Blazor " and press the Download button Restart your Visual Studio Download the latest UI for Blazor hotfix file from: The download page on our website. Please bear in mind that if you choose this way, you need to unzip the file and place it under the %appdata%\Telerik\Updates folder. This is the default download location from which our Visual Studio extensions use the product's files The Download new version dialog in our Visual Studio extensions. More details about the Telerik UI for Blazor VS extension could be found here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/getting-started/vs-integration/introduction](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/getting-started/vs-integration/introduction) I am looking forward to your reply. Regards, Yana Progress Telerik

I tried both installers before, the last install of the SDK was from Microsoft's download page. The registry is attached (SDKVersions.png) I just downloaded and installed the Telerik UI for Blazor Visual Studio Extension directly from Visual Studio. When I created a new project I got redirected to your logon page, and it is hanging up when "Redirecting you to your Desktop Application" At this point this extension appears to be installed, but when I try to use it, it wants be to upgrade and hangs (Redirecting.png)

Hi Tony, I am sorry to hear that you are facing difficulties in using our products. I have logged a new item in our backlog to further investigate the installation issue on your side. We will take it into consideration in our next planning meeting. When it comes to the redirection case, could you please check that after logging into our website, Visual Studio starts to indicate that the login is performed successfully? Please take a look at the attached vs-indication.png image. If this is happening, please bear in mind that you need first to go through our Privacy dialog (check the attached privacy-dialog.png file) and then download the hotfix. If this is not the case, could you please share with us some more details about what is happening in your Visual Studio after logging into our website? Some screenshots will be highly appreciated. I am looking forward to your feedback. Regards, Yana Progress Telerik
