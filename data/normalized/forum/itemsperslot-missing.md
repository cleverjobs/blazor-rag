# ItemsPerSlot missing?

## Question

**RobRob** asked on 04 Sep 2024

I'm trying to get the TelerikScheduler to work with Month View and was following your documentation here: Blazor Scheduler - Month View - Telerik UI for Blazor When I set ItemsPerSlot as outlined in your example code, I get an error. I followed your example code, any suggestions?

RESOLVED: I was running older version of Blazor UI (4.6.0). Upgraded to Blazor UI (6.2.0). FYI, it would be helpful if the Telerik Documentation for specific features included Version requirement.
