# Keyboard Delete or Backspace wipes out the whole date!

## Question

**RodRod** asked on 03 Feb 2021

When using the DateTimePicker, if you type or select a date, and then press the keyboard backspace, or delete button, the whole date gets deleted, which is not a good user experience. Can this behaviour be changed so that only the individual date component is blanked out, not the entire date? Note: I posted this yesterday, but it seems to have been removed.

Hello Rod, I have answered your inquiry in your original post. The reason why it seems removed to you is that we have changed the Product to DateInput. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
