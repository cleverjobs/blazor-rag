Hello John, Indeed, configuring the Scheduler to show only all-day events is possible. The approach is shown in our KB article: Display Only All-Day Appointments in the Scheduler. Please refer to it and see if that is what you are looking for. I hope you find the provided information useful. If you face any difficulties with it let me know. Regards, Tsvetomir Progress Telerik
