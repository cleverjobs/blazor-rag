## Question

**Flo** asked on 20 Jan 2020

I'm using SelectedItemsChanged to track multiple selected items in Grid. Everything works but when I pre-selecting items in OnInitializedAsync method the checkboxes doesn't get checked. I canot use @bind-SelectedItems, I need to do it manually. How can I make this checkboxes get's checked ?
