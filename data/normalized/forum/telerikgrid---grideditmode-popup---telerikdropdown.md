# TelerikGrid - GridEditMode.Popup - TelerikDropDown ?

## Question

**Lar** asked on 12 Oct 2022

Is it possible to change a textbox in the popup window for editing a row in a TelerikGrid to a TelerikDropDown ? I'm tinkering with GridPopupEditSettings and haven't been able to figure out if it's possible/how to do it.

Hi Larry, Define an EditorTemplate for the GridColumn. Editor template example for inline editing (it's practically the same approach) Grid editor templates documentation Regards, Dimo
