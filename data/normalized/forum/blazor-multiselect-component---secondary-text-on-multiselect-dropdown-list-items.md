# Blazor MultiSelect Component - Secondary text on Multiselect dropdown list Items

## Question

**Uda** asked on 23 Sep 2022

Hi, I have a use case to show the secondary text on dropdown list items. Is there a way currently to show the custom secondary text below the actual individual item in the dropdown list? I've tried using the ItemTemplate by placing two divs one for option and other for custom description text and provided a separate class. But nothing worked out. My expectation is ProductName DescriptionText ProductName DescriptionText But content is being rendered as below Thanks
