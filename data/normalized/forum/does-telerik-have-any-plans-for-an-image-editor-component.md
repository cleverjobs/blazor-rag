# Does Telerik have any plans for an image editor component?

## Question

**Xor** asked on 16 Jul 2025

I'm looking for something similar to this: [https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-image-editor](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-image-editor) Need this for annotating and editing both bitmapped and vector based graphics related to an engineering applcation.

+1 I'd vote for this. AFAIK the closest they've come is in Kendo jQuery, tho it doesn't appear you can draw or annotate? [https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/imageeditor/index](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/imageeditor/index)

Hello, A feature request has already been submitted on our Public Feedback Portal for exposing a Blazor Image Editor component: Image Editor. You can vote for the item and raise the priority even more. You can also subscribe to it to receive email notifications for status updates. The request's popularity is relatively high. This means the chance of the feature entering one of our upcoming releases is high. Things are dynamic, and the best way to stay updated with the feature status is to follow the public item.

Telerik's Image Editor for ASP.NET Core is not really an "image editor"... you can't draw (bitmap + vector), annotate (text/fonts), apply effects (rotate, scale, blur, etc.). Porting the current control to Blazor is fine, but it's not going to win any awards, I mean all it does is resize and crop... My use case needs actual image editing to be performed within the application.

Gotta agree. It's more of an image resizer/cropper than a true 'editor'.

Hello, You can share your expectations and requirements in the comments section of the public Image Editor request I shared earlier. This will help our developers consider your input when the item is prioritized and planned. Kind Regards, Hristian
