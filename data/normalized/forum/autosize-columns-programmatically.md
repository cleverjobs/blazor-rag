# Autosize Columns programmatically

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 13 May 2021

I know you can autosize a column by double clicking on the column edge, but is there any way this can be done programmatically? I would like the grid to automatically size the columns to fit there content when the grid is first displayed.

Hi Bob, You can follow such a feature here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1513384-programmatically-invoke-fit-to-width-functionality-for-the-grid-columns.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1513384-programmatically-invoke-fit-to-width-functionality-for-the-grid-columns.) You may also want to Follow this one about this happening automatically, but considering the caveats such a thing would have, I cannot say at this point whether it will become a feature or you would invoke as desired a call to resize columns when you see fit (e.g., after you update the grid data through OnRead): [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1513385-autofit-column-widths-on-data-load.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1513385-autofit-column-widths-on-data-load.)
