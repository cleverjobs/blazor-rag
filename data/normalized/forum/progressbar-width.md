# ProgressBar width

## Question

**Ste** asked on 24 Oct 2020

Hi Telerik Blazor team and users, some question regarding the width of the progress bar component: 1. Is it planned to set the width by a property, e.g. Width="100%"? 2. Currently the control width is still the same after the target device is changed by Google developer tools (attached files). Is it a bug? Regards, Stefan

Hello Stefan, That's a great question and I made an example in the docs about this: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/progressbar/overview#responsive-progressbar](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/progressbar/overview#responsive-progressbar) Regards, Marin Bratanov
