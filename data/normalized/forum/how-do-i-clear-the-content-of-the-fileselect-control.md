A user selects a file and then wishes to remove it. How do I programmatically remove the content of the fileselect? I have tried binding without success. Many thanks, Rob

Hello Rob, We have an open feature request for the ClearFiles method, which is similar to what the Upload has. I have added your Vote for it and you can click the Follow button to receive email notifications on status updates. In the public thread, you can see a workaround for the time being.
