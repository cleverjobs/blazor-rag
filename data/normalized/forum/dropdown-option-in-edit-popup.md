# Dropdown option in edit popup

## Question

**n/an/a** asked on 02 Feb 2022

Hi, I have a grid and upon editing, the user would need to be able to select only from certain items to some of the columns. For this, I would need to use a drop down list, listing the respective items. Anyone knows how would I be able to incorporate drop down lists in the PopUp editor please? Thanks! Astig

Hi Astig, You can use the EditorTemplate of the grid - it works for all edit modes, including the popup mode. Here is the documentation with several samples with dropdowns: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/templates/editor](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/templates/editor) Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
