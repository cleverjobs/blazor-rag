# Keyboard navigation issue in the wizard component

## Question

**Chu** asked on 06 Jul 2021

Easiest way to see this is to look at the demo on the Telerik Blazor site for the wizard at: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/wizard/overview?_ga=2.135424305.1441063975.1625423575-1371905116.1594731896&_gac=1.21975282.1624709398.85e5788e7d791cbf2099185965b0351c](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/wizard/overview?_ga=2.135424305.1441063975.1625423575-1371905116.1594731896&_gac=1.21975282.1624709398.85e5788e7d791cbf2099185965b0351c) Using the mouse, click in the text box for First Name somewhere before the end, so let's say you click between the 'J' and the 'o'. By pressing the right arrow, I would expect the cursor to move between the 'o' and 'h' characters, but instead, the form gets hit with a submit instead. Is there a way to disable keyboard navigation for the wizard and all the wizard steps?
