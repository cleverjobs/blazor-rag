# Gnatt Chart - Timeline Tasks are on the correct date but not the correct line

## Question

**Abb** asked on 27 Feb 2025

I am having a weird Problem. When the scroll bar gets involved my tasks are not lined up with left side of the gnatt chart. This doesn't seem to be a problem if I return the same items but return less roles. I have tried to mess with the CSS. I saw something about this being an issue when height is 100%. I have heigh set to 91vh. I am at loss. Any suggestions?

Hi Abby, From the screenshot, it looks like the entire right side (the Timeline) is misaligned, with rows appearing taller than those on the left. I attempted to reproduce the issue but was unable to, which suggests I might be missing a key detail from your scenario. Could you provide a runnable reproduction of your configuration? You can share it via the REPL platform, allowing me to observe the behavior firsthand and investigate further. I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to your response. Kind Regards, Hristian
