# Grid OnRead with default filter methods

## Question

**Hol** asked on 21 Sep 2022

Hello, I need a custom sorting method for the TelerikGrid. So according to the docs, I have to use the OnRead Event. Is there a way not the implement all filtering by myself and can I use the Telerik Filtering with the OnRead and only implement my custom sorting? Thanks Holger
