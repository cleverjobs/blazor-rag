# Browser-Print-Dialog to a set certain size by default

## Question

Is their any way to customize the size of the browser print dialog window? It currently appears in a less-than-ideal manner, especially in Microsoft Edge.

Hi Akilesh, As per my research on the topic, customizing the size of the browser's print dialog window isn't directly possible through HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The appearance and behavior of the print dialog are controlled by the user's browser and operating system settings, and they're typically not customizable by web developers.
