# Tapping into the Scheduling detail popup??

## Question

**Joh** asked on 10 Jun 2024

Is there a way to use the Scheduling editing popup component without having to go thru the scheduling calendar? My option is to recreate the functionality in my own component but I would like to use a component that is already developed.

Hello John, I confirm that you will need to implement the described scheduling popup with the help of our Window, Form and input components. We don't expose parts of our components for general use. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
