# Outlook (email) interface for Blazor UI with Office InterOp

## Question

**Jer** asked on 20 Sep 2021

I have a scenario to create an HTML version of the Blazor UI Grid and then using an email list and title open up an Outlook new email dialog, make some changes in the email and then press Send. Any plans for a Blazor UI component that would support this scenario? Gary Wood
