# Basic blazor editor editing problems

## Question

**And** asked on 18 Oct 2024

There are several very annoying bugs that have been reported multiple times by our end users that are using it on a daily basis for editing: Selection is not kept when formatting ( [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1623035-keep-selection-and-cursor-placement-after-block-operations](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1623035-keep-selection-and-cursor-placement-after-block-operations) ) State of formatting button is invalid ( [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1602216-the-state-of-the-text-formatting-buttons-is-wrong-when-moving-the-cursor-from-one-formatted-text-to-a-differently-formatted-text](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1602216-the-state-of-the-text-formatting-buttons-is-wrong-when-moving-the-cursor-from-one-formatted-text-to-a-differently-formatted-text) ) Copy/Paste buttons are missing ( [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1589151-toolbar-buttons-for-cut-copy-and-paste](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1589151-toolbar-buttons-for-cut-copy-and-paste) ) Even if read-only, it can still be edited ( [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1545579-disabled-or-readonly-editor-is-still-focusable-and-editable](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1545579-disabled-or-readonly-editor-is-still-focusable-and-editable) ) If opening a toolbar dropdown (for example color picker), it does not always close if clicking beside it in the editor. Do you plan fixing such basic editing bugs in the next release?

Hi Andreas, Thank you for showing your interest in these items, it will be noted in the team. I can confirm that their status is still Unplanned. That means no specific time frame has been assigned yet. As soon as we move a task to the short-term backlog, the status will change to "Planned", and most likely a release month will appear as well. Please stay tuned for any updates on the status of these items. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
