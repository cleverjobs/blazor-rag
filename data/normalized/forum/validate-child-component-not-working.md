# Validate child component not working?

## Question

**Ste** asked on 10 Jan 2022

The preview here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/inputs-validation-child-component](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/inputs-validation-child-component) ...is not working. I can get the binding to work when creating an item; but updating, I can't get the value to bind so it comes up with my selection showing. Is two-way binding for that example working for anyone? thanks!

Hi Steve, The knowledge base article approach you mentioned should work for Grid as well. I have prepared for you a runnable sample following the steps from there. The attached project is on .NET 6. It shows Grid child component validation. Please run and test it to see the result. Regards, Hristian Stefanov
