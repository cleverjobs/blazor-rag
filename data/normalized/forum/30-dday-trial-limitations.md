# 30 Dday Trial Limitations

## Question

**Pet** asked on 11 Sep 2020

I want to use Telerik Blazor for a POC, but what happens after the 30 day limit? Do the controls stop working or is there a limitation on them? Thanks

Hello Pete, When the trial period expires the components would still work, but you would not be able to access the new versions we provide. In case that time period is not enough for your proof of concept you could contact us for an extension. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
