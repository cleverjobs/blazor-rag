# Context Menu not closing on item click

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 14 Apr 2021

I have a context menu being opened by right clicking on a row in my grid. One of the sections is "Delete Item" which when clicked on shows a Dialog Confirm window. The problem I am having is the Confirm window is showing, but the context menu does not close (go away) so both items show on the screen (and sometimes overlap). Is there a way I can manually close the context window when an items is clicked on?
