Hi there, Does the blazor pdfviewer support password-protected PDF files? If not, is there a workaround for this? Thanks, Kurt

Hello Kurt, Can you provide more details on the exact scenario that you need to cover? In terms of securing the PDF file, do you want to be able to encrypt the file with a password, read already encrypted files, or something else? In addition, are looking for some type of UI that can handle such processing (e.g. encryption/decryption in the browser through dialogs)? Regards, Stamo Gochev

Hi there, I want to read/render an encrypted PDF file. The control should be able to detect that it is password-protected, and prompt the user for a password, and finally render the document as expected. Currently it simply shows an empty, blank document when attempting to open a password-protected PDF. I would upload a sample password-protected PDF file but the forum does not allow me to upload *.pdf extensions. Thanks, Kurt

Hi Kurt, I'm jumping into the discussion as my colleague Stamo was temporarily covering me. I carefully reviewed the provided information. Your desired functionality sounds like a good idea for a feature request in the PDFViewer. Having said that, I created a public item for it on your behalf on our Public Feedback Portal: Ability to work with password protected (encrypted, etc.) files. You are automatically subscribed, as a creator, to receive email notifications for status updates. In the meantime, if a suitable alternative approach appears with encrypted files, I will post it as a comment at the above link. Let me know if we can help with anything else. Kind Regards, Hristian
