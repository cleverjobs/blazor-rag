# Custom popup

## Question

**CAR** asked on 08 Sep 2023

Hi. I'm trying to modify the grid custom-popup-for example, so that the editform is contained in a tab with only some of the properties of the Model and other properties of the model in another tab. The problem is that the Save and Cancel buttons only appear in the first tab(the edit form). Is there a way to split the model properties into more than one tab, and have the Save and Cancel buttons outside of the tabs son that they can be clicked from any tab being active? Tnkaks

Carlos - I assume that you are using a Grid popup edit form template. In this case, see the Form Templates example. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
