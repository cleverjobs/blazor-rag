# Grid design

## Question

**Cip** asked on 21 Mar 2022

Hello everyone, Is there a possibility to set some properties regarding the design of the grid for example: - header background color - rounded corners - interlaced, flat design for the rows, now it's interlaced by default, I mean, a row white, a row grey, by flat I mean all rows in the same color, white for example I know that this changes can be done from CSS but if I do them I don't want to influence the design for the active row for example, so I'm interested if there can be a much nicer solution. Thank you, Cipri
