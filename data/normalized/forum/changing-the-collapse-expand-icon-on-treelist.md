# Changing the Collapse/Expand icon on TreeList

## Question

**Jam** asked on 20 Jul 2023

This older issue explains how to change the collapse/expand icon on the TelerikTreeList component. [https://www.telerik.com/forums/is-there-a-way-to-change-or-change-or-enlarge-treelist-expand-icon](https://www.telerik.com/forums/is-there-a-way-to-change-or-change-or-enlarge-treelist-expand-icon) is this explanation still accurate? I have implemented this approach but it has no affect. I am using version 4.3 in a Bl;azor Server app using the FluentIU theme. Thanks Jim

Hi, James Modifying the icon by changing the content is still a viable method, however, the CSS classes responsible for the icons, have changed throughout the versions. The up-to-date HTML classes responsible for the tree list expand/collapse icons k-treelist-toggle and k-svg-i-cared-alt-down/ k-svg-i-cared-alt-right. For more information on the topic, you could look at the older forum where I have answered your question in greater detail. Regards, Georgi Progress Telerik
