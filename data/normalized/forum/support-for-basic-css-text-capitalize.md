# Support for basic CSS: text-capitalize

## Question

**Jas** asked on 06 May 2022

Is there an easy way to capitalize a control like a textbox? In CSS it's just text-transform: capitalize; Bootstrap has a class called: text-capitalize.

Hello Jason, You can use the same CSS on a Telerik component too. Here's a sample: [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/GmOJYLvf43aeoXuh30.](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/GmOJYLvf43aeoXuh30.) The key thing is to find the suitable CSS cascade to target the appropriate element. The second one in the example above targets a simple telerik textbox, for example. Depending on how you want to use this, you can make it more or less specific, add or remove selectors, etc. Regards, Marin Bratanov
