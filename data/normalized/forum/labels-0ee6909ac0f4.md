## Question

Hi, You have those marvelous labels for textboxes. How can I do the same thing for other widgets like the dropdownlist for example? Thanks ... Ed

Hi Ed, At the moment, only the textboxes expose this feature. One of the chief problems in exposing it everywhere is that this changes the line height of the component and some people have found that overall result odd. Nevertheless, I'd encourage you to post feature requests for that in the Feedback Portal for the components you want to have it, so we can gauge the community interest and feedback.

Seems to me, the simple answer is to make them optional. If one guy want to use them and another doesn't, having them optional makes everybody happy. my 2 cents.

Yes, we also think so, and this is why it is likely that if this remains as a feature, it may become a separate component that will wrap type-able inputs to provide such a label, so it could be applied as-desired. At this point I can't say what its future will be. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hello again Ed, We got another report related to those floating labels and they are also causing issues with dimensions. This makes me think that they may get removed as an OOB feature, but we will see what the investigation will show.
