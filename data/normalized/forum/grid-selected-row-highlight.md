Hi Bohdan, I'm glad to hear you managed to resolve the issue yourself. If you'd like, I can delete the entire post. However, if you don't mind, I can leave a brief summary here to help other developers facing the same situation. The question was whether the Grid could use a SelectedItemsChanged event and SelectedItems together, as you needed to perform additional actions when selection is triggered. Doing additional tasks in the SelectedItemsChanged event is indeed possible when selection occurs. I'm sharing this simply so others in a similar situation can benefit from this post.
