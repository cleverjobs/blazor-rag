# Removing border of charts

## Question

**Emi** asked on 25 Nov 2021

Hello, Is there a way to remove the border around each datapoint? If I have a column chart, and I set the color of the colorfield to rgba(45, 177, 185, 1) the border around the column is black, is there a way to remove the border?. I have attached an image of the "issue". Best Regards, Emil
