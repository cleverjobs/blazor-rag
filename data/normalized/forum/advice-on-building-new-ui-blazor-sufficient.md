# Advice on building new UI: Blazor sufficient?

## Question

**fin** asked on 23 Jul 2021

i have been running on the backend of a brand new project for media control, and prepared to start digging right into a ui to talk to my graphql api. i would used asp.internet "lower back in the day", and had carried out a silverlight gui, but have not accomplished front-stop work in some time. i am looking to decide how to choose from the cutting-edge country of the sector - blazor, asp.net core, and many others. i'm a c # dev, so i would favor to do as a great deal of this as i will w / o desiring javascript help. [https://1921681254.mx/](https://1921681254.mx/) for a ui that looks incredibly similar to adobe bridge (underneath), could blazor paintings well for me today? i am privy to the component libraries from telerik and others, which in all likelihood could provide me a headstart [https://100001.onl/](https://100001.onl/)

I also thought longer about which technology might now be the best for the next projects. Blazor has a bright future ahead of it - from my point of view. On the web and mobile and desktop. For this I also tested different frameworks (DevExpress, Syncfusion). The decision fell after a few months of testing on Telerik, although I already have a license from the other two. with best regards from Berlin Matthias
