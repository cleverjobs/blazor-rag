# Telerik Grid Expand Button Tooltip?

## Question

**joh** asked on 30 Apr 2021

Hi, Is there a tooltip option to add for the expend plus button on the left of a telerik grid row. Several of my clients have wondered if I could do this? Is there a function already in the Telerik Blazor Grid component? If not, are there any examples of someone attempting this on github? My clients have employees which they believe this option/concept would be very helpful.

Hi John, I made this knowledge base article to explain how you can add tooltips to the expand buttons: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/grid-expand-button-tooltip,](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/grid-expand-button-tooltip,) and the notes section at the end offers an alternative that might be useful for some people.
