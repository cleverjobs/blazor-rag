# Did Cards drop off the roadmap?

## Question

**Dav** asked on 28 Sep 2020

I remember seeing Cards on the Blazor UI Roadmap. They were scheduled for sometime this fall I think. Now I don't see them on the roadmap. Have they been dropped? Was looking forward to using them since a lot of our apps lean in to material design.

Hello David, You can Follow a Card component here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1457323-card.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1457323-card.) In the meantime, you can make your own that wraps the HTML+CSS classes we offer through our themes, documented as an approach here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/themes/form-elements#cards](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/themes/form-elements#cards) Regards, Marin Bratanov

Hi Marin, I've seen those posts before. I was specifically asking about a Blazor implementation of Cards, and if they are no longer on the roadmap.

Hello David, A Card component might have been on the roadmap at one point, but I can't really remember. While we do plan a lot of things and stick to them, tinier things are more fluid and follow the community demand, so it is possible that they have dropped off - at the moment there are only 4 votes for it, 3 of which were added last night during the webinar and twitch stream - and that puts the cards at a rather low priority.
