# Grid Navigation not working with page up/down

## Question

**Mar** asked on 16 Dec 2021

I am using latest, edge, chrome and firefox If I enable navigation in the grid, page up/down stops to work. I can navigate the cells with the arrows keys, but unable to move up / down page by page. So for now I have disabled navigation.

Can you reproduce this with our demo: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/keyboard-navigation?](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/keyboard-navigation?) It seems to change the page for me when I use PageUp and PageDown as expected. If you can reproduce this issue with some other grid configuration, could you send us an example? You could click the Edit in Blazor REPL button to start from the existing example and make the necessary modifications, and send us a link to the new REPL snippet.

I tried the example before posting the question and it was working. Going to take the same code as in the link and try it on my page
