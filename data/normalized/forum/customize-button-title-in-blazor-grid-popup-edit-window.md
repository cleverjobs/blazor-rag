Hi Dariusz, At this stage, it is not possible to customize the text of the buttons in the popup edit form. However, we will expose such an option: Allow control over the Popup edit form Buttons at the bottom I added your vote for the item to keep proper track of the customer requests for that feature. The enhancement is currently scheduled for UI for Blazor 4.1. You may follow it to receive status updates. A possible option in the meantime is to use a custom popup for editing where you can control all the rendering: [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/custom-popup-form.](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/custom-popup-form.) I hope you will find the above information useful. Please let us know if any other questions appear. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva Progress Telerik
