Hi, You can Follow the implementation of such a feature here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1485661-clear-current-files-in-blazor-upload.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1485661-clear-current-files-in-blazor-upload.) You can also find a workaround here. Regards, Marin Bratanov

The link you gave for a workaround seems to be only for hiding the succes box all the time. I only want to remove it after I have saved the page and called StateHasChanged

Until the actual code is written that implements the feature, I'm afraid there isn't more that can be done. Not every feature or bug can have a workaround through existing public API, unfortunately.
