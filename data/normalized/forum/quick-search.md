Hello Maurice, You can Follow the implementation of a filter feature in the dropdownlist component here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1427877-filter-feature-in-the-dropdownlist.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1427877-filter-feature-in-the-dropdownlist.) In the meantime, you can use the combobox filtering feature: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/combobox/filtering.](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/combobox/filtering.)
