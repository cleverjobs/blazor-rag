# Grid filter row not clearing properly

## Question

**Eri** asked on 16 Jan 2020

I noticed this in 2.6.0 and it appears to also be present in 2.6.1. When using a filter row the clear filter button refreshes the grid with the filter removed as expected but the filter text is not removed from the textbox. I am attaching an example.

Hi Eric, Thank you for noticing. We're aware of this and we intend to have it fixed for our next release. The same goes for the datetime filter column that does not show the filter value. Regards, Marin Bratanov
