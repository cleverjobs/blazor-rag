# Change scheduler event cell size

## Question

**Akm** asked on 07 Jun 2024

I want to make the scheduler event cells bigger in height. However, I'm not able to achieve it with ItemTemplate nor overriding the css. Is there a way to achieve this? Also, why my previous question about this have been deleted? If there's no way of achieving that, why don't you just say it's not possible instead of deleting my question?
