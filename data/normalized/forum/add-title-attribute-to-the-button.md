# Add title attribute to the button

## Question

**Rya** asked on 03 Oct 2019

Hello, can you add support for the "title" attribute on the button component. It has already been requested for Kendo for Angular 2+. We would like to have this feature in Blazor as well.

Hi Ryan, This is most likely to get implemented when attribute splatting gets implemented, so I'd encourage you to Follow and/or Vote for this: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1416978-support-arbitrary-attributes.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1416978-support-arbitrary-attributes.) Right now we are a little wary of adding parameters for every property as it may get implemented through attribute splatting. The Blazor suite does not yet have a toolbar component, if you would like to see one and mere buttons/dropdowns in a container don't suffice for now, you can Follow and Vote for it here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1431584-toolbar.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1431584-toolbar.)
