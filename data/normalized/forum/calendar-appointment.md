Hello, We have the scheduler component for that, you can see it in action in its dedicated live demos: [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/scheduler/overview.](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/scheduler/overview.) The calendar itself will have templates for the days in our upcoming 2.24.0 release so you will be able to add markers and icons to them, you can preview how that will work here.
