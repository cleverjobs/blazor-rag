# Scheduler not reacting when trying to double click to add new appointment.

## Question

**Joh** asked on 07 Jun 2024

Trying to get used to the Scheduler control. Basically copying and pasting from the examples from the documentation. It displays the calendar type controls properly but does not allow me to double click and get an add form. I have AllowCreate set to true and have a handler for the OnCreate event. The double click does not trigger the OnCreate even at all. Where would I start troubleshooting this issue?
