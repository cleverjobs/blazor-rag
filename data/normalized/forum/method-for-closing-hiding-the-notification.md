Hello Is it possible to hide or close the notification from outside? I do have a notification with the possibility to answer. After clicking the button, the notification should close. Have a look at the screenshot. Thanks you and greetings from Berlin.

Hi Michelle, To get emails for status updates on that feature, click the Follow button on this page: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1498527-method-for-closing-hiding-the-notification.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1498527-method-for-closing-hiding-the-notification.) This is the best way to know when a feature gets implemented or a bug fixed. At this point, this feature is not available yet, when we implement it, the page will get updated to reflect that (its status will become "Completed") and the release number will be added.
