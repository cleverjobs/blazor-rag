# Does anyone have a good way to debug generated code errors?

## Question

**Wil** asked on 03 Aug 2022

Often I'll get an exception thrown where even running in debug mode with breakpoints it's not clear where exactly the error is. I know these are usually, if not always, errors in the generated html and js Interop files. Does anyone know of a way to dive deeper into those exceptions, or am I just kinda stuck troubleshooting line by line? Thanks!
