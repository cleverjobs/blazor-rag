# Gantt Chart color for Tree List

## Question

**Jos** asked on 04 May 2022

I want to change the color of the Tasks in the TreeList depending on what percentage it is complete. So if it is 100% done then Green otherwise say Red. Is this possible? I have not found a way to do it in Blazor. If it is not possible is it planning on being added soon?

Hi Josh, The described functionality is achievable by using the Tree Column Template and some additional CSS styles. I have prepared for you an example in this REPL link. Please run and test it to see the result. If any concerns appear upon the testing, I would be glad to help further. Regards, Hristian Stefanov
