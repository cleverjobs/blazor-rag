# "Blazor Dashboard Template" Question

## Question

**Ben** asked on 19 May 2020

Hello Team; There is an upcoming feature on the roadmap called "Blazor Dashboard Template". For our Admin App, we need a Dashboard with layout (Side/top menu, Header, Footer, Body and etc.). Before we spend the time and build this from ground up, we are hoping this component will save us some time. My question is, is there a similar control/component in other Telerik platforms that we can look at a demo, to get an idea what's coming up? If yes, could you please provide a link? If not, is it possible to get more detail information on how it will work and what we should expect? Thanks!

Hello Ben, Our UI for jQuery suite currently has the TileLayout component and you can see their demos from this link: [https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/tilelayout/index.](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/tilelayout/index.) It's also bit similar to the Dock we have in WebForms. The idea behind that component is that the developer gives the user an intuitive and quick way to drag and drop tiles in a dashboard to present data in the most convenient way for them. The Blazor Dashboard Template entry in the roadmap is a project template we intend to make that you would be able to access from the New Project Wizard. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov

Hi; I was inquiring about "The Blazor Dashboard Template" and not the first one. I'm familiar with the first one. So it's a project template and not a compound component.I'm glad I asked, as I was assuming it's going to be a component. Thanks for the clarification.

You're welcome, Ben. Thank you for asking, we just tweaked the wording on the roadmap page a little to explain this better and avoid confusion. Regards, Marin Bratanov
