# TelerikMultiSelect - Limit Height, Group More than x items into button

## Question

**Ric** asked on 28 Oct 2021

I need to use the TelerikMultiSelect with a specified Height and Width, I see how to do this, and even set the PopupCss. My Question is, say I want my MultiSelect box width to be 200px, how could I have when some selects more than one item, the box would then say 'Multiple Selected'. I'm searching but not sure how I could accomplish this.

Hello Richard, You may find a feature called "Tag mode" useful in this scenario - it provides a summary of all selected items in one tag. Such a feature will be supported in a future version of Telerik UI for Blazor and in the moment you can check its behavior in the jQuery version of the Multiselect - Tag mode. We currently have an opened request for it in our public feedback portal - Add a Tag Mode (summary tag mode). I have added your vote to increase its popularity as we are prioritizing the feature requests implementation based on the community interest and demand. As I opened the request on your behalf, you are subscribed and will receive email notifications when its status changes. This is the best way to keep in track with the progress of the feature as once we know which release will contain its implementation, we will update its status in the feedback portal and you will be notified via email accordingly. In the meantime, you can try some of the workarounds suggested in the admin edit of the public post. I hope you will find the above information useful. Please let us know if any further questions appear. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva Progress Telerik
