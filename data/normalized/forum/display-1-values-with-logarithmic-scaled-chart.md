# Display 1 values with logarithmic scaled chart

## Question

**Rev** asked on 09 Jun 2023

(I am having the same issue as this WPF forum question, but cannot seem to translate the fix for Blazor.) For the log chart, I am always wanting a bar to display as long as the value itself is not zero. Would anyone be able to help me?
