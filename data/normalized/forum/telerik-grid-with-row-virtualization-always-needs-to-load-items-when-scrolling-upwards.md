# Telerik Grid with row virtualization always needs to load items when scrolling upwards.

## Question

**Bra** asked on 11 Feb 2025

When using the Data Grid with row virtualization we set a pagesize large enough so with normal usage you almost never see the rows loading when scrolling downwards. However when scrolling upwards rows always need to be loaded. The pagesize only affects the items loaded downwards. From a user experience this is counterintuitive because the rows are visible when first opening the grid, but after scrolling down and back up the rows now need to be loaded again. Is there a way to have items preloaded in both directions so we always get a smooth user experience?
