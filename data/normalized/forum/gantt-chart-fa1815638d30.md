Is there an rough estimate for the release date/quarter of the Gantt chart.

Hello Eric, The best way to know when it becomes available is to click the Follow button on its Feedback Portal page: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1419052-gantt-chart.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1419052-gantt-chart.) It also offers a workaround you can consider for the time being (using a jQuery widget). When we know which release will contain the Gantt component, we will update that page as well and you would get an email then. Regards, Marin Bratanov
