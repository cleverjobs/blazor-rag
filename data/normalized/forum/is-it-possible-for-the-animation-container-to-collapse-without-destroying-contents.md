Hi Eric, At this stage it is not possible to hide the Animation Container without destroying its contents, however it sounds like a reasonable and useful feature. Therefore, I opened a request for it in our public feedback portal - Hide Animation Container with CSS only without destroying its contents. I have added your vote to increase its popularity as we are prioritizing the feature requests implementation based on the community interest and demand. As I opened the request on your behalf, you are subscribed and will receive email notifications when its status changes. This is the best way to keep in track with the progress of the feature as once we know which release will contain its implementation, we will update its status in the feedback portal and you will be notified via email accordingly. I hope you will find this information useful. Please let us know if any further questions appear. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva Progress Telerik
