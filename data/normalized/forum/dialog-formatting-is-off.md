I am using the fluent theme and for some reason the dialogs styles are mushed. I have not customized them in any way. Any idea what might be causing the problem?

Hello Eric, This means that the app is using an outdated CSS theme. Please check steps 3 and 4 in the Upgrade Procedure. Custom themes must be recreated in the ThemeBuilder. If you are 100% sure that the referenced CSS file in the app is correct, then clear the browser cache. Regards, Dimo
