# Shape Files on Map Display

## Question

**And** asked on 23 Apr 2024

Other providers seem to have the ability to allow shape files on their map components but I only see GeoJson examples on your map component. Do you have examples of how to display shape files on your map (shp, dbf, prj, sbn, sbx, shx) or is that not possible?

Hi Andrew, Indeed, we don't support such shape files at the moment. We have a feature request for PBF. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
