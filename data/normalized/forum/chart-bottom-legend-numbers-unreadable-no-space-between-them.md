# Chart bottom legend numbers unreadable, no space between them

## Question

**Alb** asked on 02 Aug 2021

I am testing a chart with bar lines but the horizontal legend at the bottom all the numbers collapse with the others It also happens in other charts where so many numbers or dates that are not legible, is there any workaround to avoid this and reduce the number of numbers/intervals?
