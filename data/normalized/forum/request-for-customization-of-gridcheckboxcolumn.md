# Request for customization of <GridCheckboxColumn>

## Question

**Jör** asked on 18 Nov 2024

Dear support team, I am very satisfied with the functionality of <GridCheckboxColumn>. Is there a way to easily replace the “Check” icon with a “Radio” icon when the GridSelectionMode.Single is set? This would make it immediately clear to users that only one row can be selected in the grid. Thank you very much for your support!

Here's how you can do it: REPL link. Please run and explore the REPL sample to see which CSS styles you need to achieve the desired customization. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
