## Question

Hi everyone When using a translated ListView, the page size selector behaves weird. When the dropdown is opened, the correct text ("Alle") gets displayed. But when the dropdown is closed, the english text is shown, Any ideas? Thanks alot and have a nice day

Hello Luca, The problem is not in the translation, but in the DropDownList width. Please refer to the linked forum thread for additional information and a CSS workaround. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
