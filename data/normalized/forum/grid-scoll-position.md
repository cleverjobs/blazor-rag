Hello Khashayar, There is an open Feature Request regarding the Grid to scroll back to the top after paging. You can see it from here. Virtual Scrolling is an alternative to paging and as such a workaround similar to the one posted in the thread should work in your case too. If this feature request fits your needs you can Vote for it and Follow it to receive email notifications on status updates. With virtual scrolling, you can also use the grid state to set the Skip setting to 0 (or the desired amount). If this does not work for you, send us more details on the desired behavior and a runnable sample project so we can propose further solutions. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
