# Frozen grouping name

## Question

**Mau** asked on 02 Apr 2021

I have a very wide grid with a horizontal scrollbar and the first few columns are frozen so this info stays in the screen. This works well until I use grouping and collaps the various grouped data. If you expand the grouped data the frozen columns stays visible and all is fine. If you collaps the grouped data the text in the frozen columns aren't visible and if you scroll to the right the header field of the grouping is gone. in the picture I have grouped by employee and scrolled to the right
