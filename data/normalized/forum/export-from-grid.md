Found this... [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/print](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/print) Seems to work well

Hello Jonathan, The implementation of Exporting the Grid to Excel or PDF is planned for R3 2020 (May - September). You can see more of our long-term planning for new features and enhancements on our Roadmap (link: [https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/roadmap](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/blazor-ui/roadmap) ). Having said that, you can Follow the implementation and receive email notifications on status updates of both the features from our Feedback Portal: Export to PDF: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1434269-export-grid-to-pdf](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1434269-export-grid-to-pdf) Export to Excel: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1431614-export-grid-to-excel](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1431614-export-grid-to-excel) I have already given your Vote for both of them. On the Telerik Reporting - it is a separate toolset and component, and reporting is highly specific, so it does not match exactly the UI for Blazor grid. You can read more about the Blazor Report Viewer we have here: [https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/blazor-report-viewer-how-to-use.](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/blazor-report-viewer-how-to-use.)
