# Is scaffolding supported for Telerik UI for Blazor to generate CRUD UI and code?

## Question

**Irf** asked on 06 Aug 2021

Hello Team, Currently, we are investigating Telerik UI for Blazor for our upcoming project, as our project has many CRUD operations to perform, and we are looking for a quick way to do this using the scaffolding with .Net 5 & EF Core and generate required CRUD Blazor components with entity model standard validations. There is scaffolding for Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core: [https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-core/installation/scaffolding](https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-core/installation/scaffolding) I could not find any documentation or articles about scaffolding with Telerik UI for Blazor. (I searched in Telerik docs, blogs, forums.) 1. Does Telerik UI for Blazor components support scaffolding for CRUD operations? 2. If yes, where can I find the documentation and steps to generate the scaffolding? 3. If not, is the Telerik team planning to introduce scaffolding in upcoming releases? Currently, we found out that Syncfusion supports "Blazor UI" scaffolding, but we have a slight preference for Telerik UI. Looking forward to your answers. Thanks!

Hello Irfan, Currently, we do not have a scaffolder for the Telerik UI for Blazor suite, but that's something we definitely look at for the future of the product suite. I have opened a new feature request on our public Feedback Portal - add Scaffolding.
