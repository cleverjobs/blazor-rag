# Combobox with ability to select multiple values / Multiselect with tagging functionality

## Question

**Ala** asked on 27 Jul 2023

Hi, I'm trying to create a combobox which can select multiple values or a multiselect with tagging functionality like the one in the Angular suite of controls ( [https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dropdowns/multiselect/custom-values/](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/dropdowns/multiselect/custom-values/) ). We are migrating our codebase at the moment and there is no adequate substitute to replicate the same behavior. I did come across the proposed solution ( [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/multiselect/add-new-item/MultiSelectAndAddButton](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/multiselect/add-new-item/MultiSelectAndAddButton) ) but its implementation feels very inorganic. Is there some way this can be incorporated into the control and have a cleaner implementation from a consuming-developer's point of view?
