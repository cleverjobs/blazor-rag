# Import JSON variables in Theme Builder - what happened?

## Question

**Twa** asked on 09 Aug 2023

Good afternoon, A simple and straightforward way to maintain customized themes when facing a new release of Telerik for Blazor was to import theme variables from a .json file. This would generate new themes according to our needs, and we could then download and apply the update. In the current Theme Builder, I cannot find an option to import the .json file; I can only import from Figma. Additionally, importing metadata does not seem to be what I am looking for. Could you please guide me on how to achieve what I need to do? Best regards. Twain

I'm aware that I can manually input the variables one by one, but the idea is to avoid spending time on this process.
