Is it possible to show a different result in the UI once a certain number of items has been selected?

Hello Roger, I would like to ask you for some additional feedback to sort out the exact functionality you refer to. We have similar behavior where the input field runs out of space the component should display the number of selected items rather than their text representation like in this demo: [https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/combobox/examples/functionality/checkboxes/defaultcs.aspx](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/combobox/examples/functionality/checkboxes/defaultcs.aspx) This is, however, applicable for a simpler input, while the multiselect component adds tokens (chips, as they are called nowadays) in the input, so it has fundementally a different behavior. So, if you expect the component to have other behavior than the one in the demo above, could you give us more details on what that behavior should be? I would encourage you to post a feature request for such a feature in our Feedback Portal ( [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor) ) through the "Request a Feature" button (located in the top right hand side of the screen). Make sure to select the "make public" checkbox at the final step. This will let you explain your goals, requirements, even perhaps add a sample of what API and functionality you would expect it exposes. You can then Vote for it and Follow it to get updates on status changes. If it gets good traction with the community, we will consider its implementation. Regards, Svetoslav Dimitrov
