Hi Team, I have more
than 10000 items, after click on TelerikMultiSelect control it is
taking 5 seconds to load the popup. Do we

Hi, You can Follow this page to know when virtualization becomes available in the various dropdowns: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1457808-combobox-virtualization.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1457808-combobox-virtualization.) The thread also contains a few ideas you can consider in the meantime (such as a grid with virtual scrolling and selection inside an animation container, a similar example is available in one of the linked pages ).
