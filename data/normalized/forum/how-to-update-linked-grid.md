## Question

**Pav** asked on 08 Sep 2022

There is a sample [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/events#onrowclick](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/events#onrowclick) and it works perfectly. There is one problem i should to click on it to activate it and update linked grid. How can i activate a top (parent) grid without click on that ?
