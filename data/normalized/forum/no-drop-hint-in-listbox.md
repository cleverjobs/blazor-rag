# No drop hint in ListBox?

## Question

**Luk** asked on 29 Jan 2024

During drag'n'drop, the Grid has a drop hint to indicate where a row will be placed. (See e.g. [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/drag-drop](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/drag-drop) ) The ListBox does not have a drop hint, making it hard to guess in which position the dragged element will end up in. (See e.g. [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/listbox/drag-drop](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/listbox/drag-drop) ) Can you add the drop hint? TYVM Lukas
