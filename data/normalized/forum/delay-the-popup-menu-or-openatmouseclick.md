## Question

Hi Is there a way to delay the opening of the TeleriklMenu ( use case : the menu is used in a table and each time the mouse goes over, the popup appears. I want to prevent this by putting a delay before showing the Popup A workaround could be to show the popup only at mouse click Thanks

Hello Daniel, The Menu by design should open when the user hovers over it. However, adding a delay to prevent accidental opening is a valid feature request. I have logged a feature request on your behalf. Here is the link to the Feedback Portal item: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1594621-add-delay-on-hover-before-opening-and-closing-menu-items](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1594621-add-delay-on-hover-before-opening-and-closing-menu-items) I have added a vote to the feature request on your behalf since the votes are an indicator we use when planning feature requests for subsequent releases. The more votes a feature request gets, the sooner it will be scheduled for implementation. As a creator, you are automatically subscribed to receive email notifications about status changes.===Disabling the open-on-hover behavior and opening the Menu on click is an already discussed feature. However, currently, the API does not expose such a configuration, but we have a logged feature request in the feedback portal: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1537586-expose-openon-and-closeon-action-parameters-in-the-menu](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1537586-expose-openon-and-closeon-action-parameters-in-the-menu) I have added your vote for it too. You can also subscribe to receive email notifications when its status changes. I understand this can be a limitation for a case like this one in the application you are working on and I am sorry if this is a show-stopper for you. Regards, Yanislav Progress Telerik
