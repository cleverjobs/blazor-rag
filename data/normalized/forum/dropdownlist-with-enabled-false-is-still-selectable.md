# DropDownList with Enabled="false" is still selectable

## Question

**Cla** asked on 11 May 2022

Hi, if i set the property Enabled="false" the component is grayed but i can still change the selected item from ui. It's a bug? I would like to disable dropdownlist to be opened or to be selectable from the user. Thanks

I can't reproduce this with the following example: [https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wQOJPFbj265QRu8O00.](https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wQOJPFbj265QRu8O00.) If comparing against it does not help, please post an updated sample that shows how to reproduce this, together with the needed steps.

If you don't want the dropdownlist to be opened or selectable, could you use a different component instead? It sounds like you would like the functionality of a text box.
