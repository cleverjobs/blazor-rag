# NavigateTo site with SSL certificate

## Question

**Hie** asked on 28 Aug 2019

Hi! I'm new to Telerik and I'm working on a task to bypass SSL certificate in Chrome browser. I did some research and seem like this issue can be handled in IE but not easy for other browsers. One way we can do this is to use key strokes (i.e. "Tab" and "Enter"). The problem i'm facing is the NavigateTo("url") command throws an inner exception whenever I try to navigate to a Privacy Page. How do I solve this issue? Is there a way to manually enter url address into address bar without using the NavigateTo() function? Hien
