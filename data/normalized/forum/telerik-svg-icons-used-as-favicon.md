# Telerik SVG Icons used as favicon

## Question

**Mar** asked on 10 Mar 2023

How can I download a Telerik SVG icon and use it in my manifest file? I have created a shortcut menu and would like to use the following icons on the menu items k-i-eye, k-i-track-changes-accept, trade k-i-file-add. I know how to use the Telerik icons in code. But for this I need to have them in www/images

You need to create a static svg file. For this you could copy the content that is generated by including the svg icon in a page. In the source code or developer tools, locate the SVG tag and select it <path d="HERE IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR" fill="#241F20"/> Then with this go to GIMP or Inkscape and create the image you need. The steps to do this can be easily found in any tutorial. Good luck.
