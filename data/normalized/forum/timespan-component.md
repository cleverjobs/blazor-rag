# Timespan Component

## Question

**Raw** asked on 17 Oct 2023

Hi, Is there a way of having a timespan (or duration) component in Blazor at all, like the one mentioned here for Xamerin: [https://www.telerik.com/blogs/choose-time-duration-telerik-timespan-picker-xamarin](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/choose-time-duration-telerik-timespan-picker-xamarin) Apologies if I have missed it in the docs. Regards, Rawden.
