# How to open TelerikComboBox on click

## Question

**TedTed** asked on 09 Feb 2023

Hi, I don't see an OnClick or OnFocus event for the TelerikComboBox. How can I get the TelerikComboBox to open when its body is clicked (i.e., instead of only opening when the down arrow is clicked)? Also need to make sure the click is handled correctly so that the event does not interfere with a click in the Clear box.
