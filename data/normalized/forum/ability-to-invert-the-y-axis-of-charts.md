# Ability to Invert the Y-axis of Charts

## Question

**Cha** asked on 16 Nov 2023

Hi I believe this is a basic functionality especially for line, bar, column, and area charts but unfortunately it seems to not yet be supported. I can see that Kendo already supports inverting of the axis on some charts, but Blazor doesn't seem to have this feature stated in the documentation yet. yAxis.reverse - API Reference - Kendo UI Chart - Kendo UI for jQuery (telerik.com) Is there any plan to support this anytime soon? Thanks Charles

Hi Charles, Until you get a response from someone at Telerik, there is a relevant feature request we can vote on: Reverse setting for the Labels on the Chart Value Axis (telerik.com) Thanks, Mark

Hello Charles, Mark, Thanks for sharing your developer needs. I must admit that we don't have reversed (inverted) axes in our plans for the next several months. This can change, depending on customer demand. The status of the feature request that Mark linked represents the official information about the work item. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
