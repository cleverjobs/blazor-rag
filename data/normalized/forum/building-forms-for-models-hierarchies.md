# Building forms for models hierarchies

## Question

**Twa** asked on 11 Oct 2022

In certain situations I need to create forms based on hierarchical models. Initially let's assume something simple like: ClassA may have many common properties (and complex ways to edit them) and consequently I would like them to be reused when creating the forms for ClassB and for ClassC. What do you think is the best solution? At the moment with the different attempts that I have made have not been satisfactory. Greetings.
