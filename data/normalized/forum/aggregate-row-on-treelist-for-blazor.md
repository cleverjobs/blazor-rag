Hello Stuart, A feature request for adding an aggregates functionality in the TreeList has already been submitted in our feedback portal: FooterTemplate with aggregates, totals, and grand totals in the TreeList. I voted on your behalf to raise its priority. Currently, its status is Unplanned. You can also subscribe to the item to get notified of any status updates via email.
