# Toolbar is hiding items

## Question

**Fab** asked on 13 May 2025

I have a TelerikToolbar like this: TelerikToolBar OverflowMode="ToolBarOverflowMode.None" And it normally displays all items correctly. I wanted to change the enabled state etc. of the toolbar depending on which element is selected in a sibling component (a treelist). When I select items randomly, the toolbar suddenly starts hiding some buttons with "display.none" on the element css style, without me adding it. I assume this is a bug.

Hi Fabian, Can you please provide an isolated runnable sample that replicates your exact configuration and reproduces the problematic behavior you are hitting, so we can look further into it? You may use the REPL tool to easily share the code. It is not needed to share your actual data, you can add some dummy data as in our documentation samples. Thank you in advance for your cooperation!
