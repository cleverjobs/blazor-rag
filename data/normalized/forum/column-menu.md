# Column-Menu

## Question

**Mat** asked on 06 Jul 2021

Hello everyboy! I use a Splitter with two panes. In every pane is a grid. The second pane ist about 35% high. If I click on the Column-Menu, a popup appears - usually it drops down... but then I can not use the filter anymore, because it is to less space to show the filter, the buttons and so on.. at the moment I enlarge the popup in height (css) and the popup always pops up in the right direction. But this ist just a workaround and looks pretty ugly :-) - Has anyone an idea? Have a look at the attachment... Thanks!

Hi Matthias, You are right - the column menu does not take into account its filtering part when it positions itself. I have logged this as a bug on your behalf and you will receive email notifications for status updates: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1527031-the-filtering-part-of-the-grid-column-menu-overflows-the-screen](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1527031-the-filtering-part-of-the-grid-column-menu-overflows-the-screen) I also updated your Telerik points. I experimented to find a better workaround, but came to the conclusion that your approach is the only possible one. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
