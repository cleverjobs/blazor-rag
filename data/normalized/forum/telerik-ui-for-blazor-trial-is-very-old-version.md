# Telerik.UI.For.Blazor.Trial is very old version

## Question

**imw** asked on 24 Jan 2022

It seems like you have forgotten to update your Trial for Telerik Blazor. The latest version for that is still 2.30 which is a really old version, from 2019 I think, so people trying out that won't be close to the current version. Also if they buy a license without updating thinking they already have the latest version as they just installed it. It is listed as having been updated December 8 but I doubt that based on the version number. You might want to look into this.

Hi, No, the version is just a week ago from 2.30 to 3.0, so is still a fairly recent version best regards

Ah, I see the problem here, seems Telerik is using a bit odd numbering for the releases, as it would seem that 2.30 is the same as 2.3, in which case something like 2.9 would be newer, but apparently you need to be extra careful here as there is infact a 2.3 version as well, so 2.3 isn't the same as 2.30. Not sure why that is preferred over something like 2.3.12, 2.4.23 etc but I guess it is what it is.
