# Date format shown in empty TelerikDatePicker

## Question

**Pin** asked on 10 Aug 2023

I have this TelerikDatePicker <TelerikDatePicker @bind-Value="@WensDatum" Format="dd-MM-yyyy" Placeholder="" id="wensdatum"></TelerikDatePicker> private DateTime? WensDatum; But when the user clicks on the DatePicker textbox, the Date Format is shown. I would like that when the user clicks on the text box it stays empty. But I haven't found a solution for that. Is this possible?

Hi Pino, I confirm that the desired functionality of having the date input empty (without showing the Format) upon clicking on it will be possible as soon as we implement this feature request: Remove the DateInput mask and type free text. I voted for it on your behalf and raised the priority. You can also subscribe to it to receive email notifications for status updates. Rest assured that if any feasible alternative approaches emerge in the meantime, I will promptly share them via the above link. I remain at your disposal if we can assist with more information.
