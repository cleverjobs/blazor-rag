# Maui Blazor Android 11 support

## Question

**Sof** asked on 20 May 2025

How could I downgrade the trial version of UI for Blazor to 7.x to test it on Android 11? I plan to use Maui Blazor. Or does the newest version support it?

Hi Sofiia, We backdated your trial license, so you should have access to Telerik UI for Blazor 7.1.0 now. Please keep in mind that we officially support only the latest browser versions. Using up-to-date operating systems and browsers (or web views) is highly recommended. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik

Hi Dimo We need to use Telerik for blazor using MAUI Hybrid on Android 11, unfortunately it fails with next error, however it works well on higher android versions. When we use 8.x.x or 7.x.x we still get same error on android 11

Hi Ruslan, Indeed, the issue is related to the use of older Android versions, such as Android 11 and below. The reason is that our components adhere to system requirements, which dictate support exclusively for the latest version of Chrome (including Android and iOS), Firefox, Edge, and Safari (macOS and iOS). Should any issues persist even after adhering to the aforementioned requirements, rest assured that I am here to assist you promptly in resolving them. Note: If any different plans appear for version support, I will immediately update the above "system requirements" article. Kind Regards, Hris
