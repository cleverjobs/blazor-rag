Hey, I have tasks in my gantt view which are corresponding to older dates. Is there any option, so I can scroll to today datetime or any specific date?

Hi Grzesiek, We currently have a feature request for exposing an option to set selected date. It will allow you set your desired date that the Timeline will scroll to - be that today or any other date. I added your vote to the request to increase its popularity as we prioritize the component enhancements based on the community interest and demand. You may follow the item to receive email notifications on status updates. This is the best way to keep in track with the progress of the feature. In addition, we will also expose an option to select date range which you might be interested in. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva
