Hello Andrea, I have opened a new Feature Request on your behalf in our public Feedback Portal, which you can see from this link. I have added your Vote for it and you can Follow it to receive email notifications on status updates. That kind of manipulations should be done from an event equivalent to the OnRead for the Grid.
