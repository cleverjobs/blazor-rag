Yup, not going to get very far with this one: InvalidOperationException: The type 'Telerik.Blazor.Components.RootComponent.TelerikRootComponent' declares a parameter matching the name 'ChildContent' that is not public. Parameters must be public.

Hello everyone, We just shipped the 1.7.0 release that is compatible with Preview 9 (less than a business day after the framework release dropped). Please upgrade to it and things should work :) If not, send me a message. If you are using the CDN for our JS Interop file, don't forget to update its URL too. Regards, Marin Bratanov

Thanks! We did our best to make this happen as soon as possible, the preview came in at 10PM our time, and tomorrow's a bank holiday (but I'll be here in case someone needs help). --Marin
