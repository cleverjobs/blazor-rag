# I want to make the carousel crossfade instead of slide

## Question

**Noa** asked on 20 Sep 2023

I want to have a carousel on my page that fades instead of sliding, but there is no parameter that I can find to set this. The animation container is able to use a fade animation. [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/animationcontainer/overview](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/animationcontainer/overview) I would want it to function similarly to bootstraps version of crossfade. [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/) Would I be better off trying to customize the existing carousel component somehow? Could the effect I want be achieved with CSS? Do I need to make a feature request, and where would I do that?

Hello Noah, Currently, the Telerik Blazor Carousel API doesn't provide an option for customizing the transition effect. However, if you have specific ideas or suggestions for features like the one you're looking for (a way to configure the carousel transition animation), please feel free to share them with us in the Feedback Portal. If you decide to submit a request, it would be greatly appreciated if you could provide more details on how you envision this feature working. Please rest assured that our team pays close attention to the feature requests submitted in the portal. If a request is marked as " Unplanned," it means it's considered a valid suggestion. Subsequently, based on the level of interest from the community, we'll consider scheduling it for implementation in future releases. I hope this information is helpful to you!
