# Does the Filter control offer configuration options for depth of query?

## Question

**Chr** asked on 11 Mar 2022

I would like to limit how many nested groups in the Filter the user can make. Something like MaxNestedDepth. Does something like this exist? I couldn't see it in the docs. Thanks. PS: there is no tag for the Filter control, Grid was the closest related control I could find.

Hi Chris, Currently, the filter does not provide out of the box the desired functionality. Still, the described Filter behavior sounds like a very nice idea for a feature request. I will raise a discussion with our development team about this. I will come back here as soon as possible with more details. Thank you for your patience in the meantime!

Thanks Hristan, It would also be nice to have events raised when filters are added.

Hi Chris, As a result of the discussion, I opened a feature request on your behalf for events (add/remove) on our Public Feedback Portal: Expose Cancellable events for adding and removing a filter field With these events, you will be able to achieve the desired result. You are also automatically subscribed to receive email notifications for status updates. Thank you once again for your patience and the provided idea. Regards, Hristian Stefanov
