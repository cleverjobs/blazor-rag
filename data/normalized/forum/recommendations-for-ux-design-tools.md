# Recommendations for UX Design tools

## Question

**Thi** asked on 05 Feb 2021

We've recently purchased Telerik Blazor UI components for our developers. Now, does anyone have a recommendation for a 'mock up' tool that uses similar/identical components to Telerik's Blazor UI components? I'd love to get the designers creating some mockups without having these non-technical users having to install Visual Studio.
