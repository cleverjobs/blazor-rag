# Chart tooltips sometimes show outside of browser window

## Question

**Dat** asked on 04 Aug 2020

I have a chart which is essentially 100% of the browser window. Tooltips are standard code like: <ChartTooltip Visible="true" Shared="true" /> When the user hovers at the bottom of the chart item then the tooltip goes off screen and is cut off.
