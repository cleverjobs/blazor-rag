# Drag Select Multiple Rows

## Question

**Eri** asked on 26 Feb 2025

Hi, In the Kendo grid we could drag the cursor over several rows to select them. This is sometimes more convenient that using Ctrl and Shift keys for multiple row selection. Is this possible in the Blazor Grid? Thanks

I am familiar with this feature in Kendo UI for jQuery, but as far as I know, it is not supported in Telerik UI for Blazor.

Hi all, I confirm that the drag selection in the Blazor Grid is available as part of the cell selection feature. Here is a live demo where you can test it: Grid - Cell Selection. Regards, Hristian Stefanov

Thanks, can this be applied to row selection, not just cell selection?

Hi Erik, Apologies for not mentioning earlier that while the functionality is available for cell selection, it is not currently supported for row selection in the Blazor Grid. However, there is an open feature request for this: Lasso Selection. I have voted for it on your behalf and raised its priority. You can also subscribe to it to receive email notifications about future status updates. Kind Regards, Hristian
