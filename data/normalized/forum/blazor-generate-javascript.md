Hello Manish, As far as I understand, you are searching for instructions on how to update the javascript files in your Blazor project. Is that correct? If you refer to the Telerik javascript file, we have documentation on how to upgrade to a new version of Telerik UI for Blazor. If you refer to other js files in your Blazor project, I found an online discussion on how to update the version of the js file in Visual Studio, which might help. Regards, Nansi Progress Telerik
