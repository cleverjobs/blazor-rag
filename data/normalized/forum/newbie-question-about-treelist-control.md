# Newbie question about TreeList control

## Question

**Ell** asked on 21 Mar 2022

Hi, We're new to Teleric UI control and we plan to build a one page on Blazer client and use Blazor server in the Server side. The server contains business logic to connect to a Azure DB. On client side, we provide a simple textbox to input search parameter and trigger a DB search. The result will be returned by several stored procedure kind of functions. On the client side, we hope to display a tree. When user click the root node, it'll expand with 3 child nodes. We hope to do data binding to a data table in the node. Does TreeList or TreeView control support that functionality? Thanks, Ellen

Hi Ellen, I'm glad to hear you are testing our product. The described scenario seems possible to accomplish most likely with our TreeList. Our components provide the UI part, and it depends on the developers to decide how their data comes. Could you please clarify, a bit more, what "binding to a data table in the node" means here? Is it a similar approach to this - Grid Data Table, but in TreeList? I look forward to your reply.
