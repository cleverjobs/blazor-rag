# Telerik Blazor Grid Inline Editing for the First Five Rows Triggered by External Button

## Question

**Hyp** asked on 10 May 2024

Hello, I'm currently working on implementing inline editing for the first five rows of a Telerik Grid for blazor upon a button click. Is it possible to achieve this, and if so, could you please provide guidance on how to do it? The button triggering the inline editing functionality is placed outside the grid. Thank you
