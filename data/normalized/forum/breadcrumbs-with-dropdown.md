# Breadcrumbs with dropdown

## Question

**Mar** asked on 22 Feb 2022

Is it possible to have breadcrumbs with dropdowns? Like this I have a page with a list of widgets. Each widget show some data and has a detail button. Details are displayed to the right of the list. So the dropdown will have an entry for each widget
