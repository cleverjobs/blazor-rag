# OpenOnFocus for AutoComplete component

## Question

**Len** asked on 12 Dec 2023

Hi, I want to be able to open the dropdown of the AutoComplete component upon focus of the input field. I found this can be done with a workaround using Js interop: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/inputs-open-programmatically](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/inputs-open-programmatically) However, I feel this functionality should be supported out of the box through some 'OpenOnFocus' parameter on the component. It would be a very welcome improvement! Kind regards, Lennert
