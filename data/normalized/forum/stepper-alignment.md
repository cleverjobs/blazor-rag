Hi Ilan, Wrap each Stepper in a container with a suitable width. For example - 800px for the first Stepper and 600px for the second one. The Stepper uses CSS Grid for its layout and there is no straight-forward way to adjust the individual steps, so that they align to another Stepper. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
