Hello Evgeny, The sample from the docs works for me when I add paging to it so I suggest that you: upgrade to the latest version (2.26.0 at the moment) compare against the sample in the dos to see what is different in your setup to cause the issue open a support ticket with an example of the problem if this does not help you resolve the situation Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
