# Blazor Navigation with Tabstrip

## Question

**Oct** asked on 17 Feb 2023

Hi I am swtiching from asp.net ajax to blazor server. I have used your controls for many years. I developed a navigation with tabstrips in 2 levels you can view a short video [https://youtu.be/r27mRYvaxlk](https://youtu.be/r27mRYvaxlk) I used a aspx with RadSpliter: on top I put the main menu this calls js function to add new Tab on Tabstrip and put another aspx inside. Ypu can see on video that Url never changes. I want to replicate it now in Blazor, can I do with your controls? Thanks in advance

Hello Octavio, ASP.NET AJAX and Blazor are very different in terms of dynamic (runtime) control of rendered content. The Blazor way to do this is more "declarative" so to say. Check this KB article about dynamic TabStrip tabs. Regards, Dimo
