# Parent nodes showed at the bottom of the children nodes

## Question

**Cip** asked on 29 Dec 2020

Hi everyone, Is there any possibility to show the parent nodes at the bottom of their children nodes not on top? I know this may sound hilarious to you but what I'm trying to get is some kind of total rows which are the parents of the children nodes and it would be nice if they would appear at the bottom not at the top of the children nodes. Thank you. Best regards, Cipri

Hello Cipri, I've added your Vote for the ability to have aggregates and totals in the treelist, you can Follow that feature here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1488604-aggregates-totals-and-grand-totals-in-the-treelist.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1488604-aggregates-totals-and-grand-totals-in-the-treelist.) Putting the parent rows at the bottom is not something that is possible. Regards, Marin Bratanov
