# Flat Data IdField, ParentIdField as string types

## Question

**Cip** asked on 06 Apr 2021

Hi everyone, For Flat Data, the IdField and the ParentIdField can only point to int type properties in the model? It seams that if those properties are strings the TreeList does not display anything. Is there any solution to set the IdField and the ParentIdField to point to properties that are of type string? Thank you. Best regards, Cipri
