# Tile Layout dynamic content on tiles

## Question

**Cip** asked on 23 Sep 2021

Hi everybody, I would like to use your TileLayout Component in my application but when I looked at your examples I saw that the content of your tiles is hardcoded. In my solution in a tile I could have, a grid, a char or a text. How should I set dynamically the content of the tile? Which could be the right approach? Best regards, Cipri
