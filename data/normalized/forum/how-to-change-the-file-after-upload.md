# How to change the file after upload

## Question

**Nik** asked on 29 Jul 2022

Hi, How do you change the file after upload? Actually, I upload images and display them as cards on the website, but I want a feature that can change the uploaded files one by one when I click on the card. If I click on card1 that is linked to image1 I want to be able to change that image to another image or delete. I can't see how to do that with Upload component. Best regards,

This is not something you do with an upload component. Likely some custom buttons in the tool you use to render them can offer delete/edit functionality, and maybe you also need an image editor.
