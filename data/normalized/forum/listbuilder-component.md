# Listbuilder component

## Question

**Mar** asked on 23 Sep 2021

Hi, I want to ask if anyone has ideas for implementing a Listbuilder component. Would like what the best components to use and some ideas for the data model. Ideally it will be a reusable component. The lists should be filterable. I don't see that you have a listbox. Should I use a grid? What I would like is this [https://blazor.radzen.com/listbox.](https://blazor.radzen.com/listbox.) I think you should look closer to what Radzen is doing. The have more ready to use component for building a UI. Their components looks much better and the have all the common functionality that you need. Telerik components are more generic and it's not always easy to find the right component for the use case. Why don't you have a Listbox? So after two Telerik project I think Telerik has a killer grid but over all Radzen is the better one.

Hi Martin, Thanks for sharing your feedback. There is a public ListBox feature request, which is currently gathering votes and awaiting prioritization. It is in the top 20 list of most wanted new components, but still, there are quite a few other components, which are more desired. Normally, we allocate our development resources to the features and components that will bring the most value to our customers. Please vote for the feature request to increase its popularity, and follow it to receive status updates. The page also suggests ways to achieve similar behavior programmatically with a Grid.
