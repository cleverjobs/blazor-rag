# Issue with Dropdowns, buttons, images/charts and shapes missing in excel files when using Telerik RadSpreadProcessing

## Question

**Man** asked on 22 Nov 2024

I am working with an excel template (.xlsm) that contains dropdowns, buttons, images, charts and few shapes. I use Telerik radspread processing to read this template and insert data into it. However, when I download the modified excel file (.xlsm), these elements are missing. It seems that RadSpread Processing is unable to read or preserve these elements. Is there a way to retain them when manipulating .xlsm files, or any workaround to handle such cases? Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Hello Manisha, I am sorry to hear you are experiencing unexpected results. I would gladly like to help you with this case however without having any resources at my disposal which I can examine, my assistance can be very limited. One of the causes of this behavior could be missing support from the SpreadProcessing library. We already have a few feature requests logged in our Feedback Portal that might be related. For example: SpreadProcessing: Add support for shapes - disappearing shapes. SpreadProcessing: Implement support for form controls - disappearing form controls (Button, ComboBox, Check Box, etc.) That said, I am unable to confirm these assumptions as I do not have access to the actual document. With that in mind, in order for me to get a better context and understanding of the scenario you are experiencing, would you be able to share with us the XLSM file you are using to reproduce this behavior? This way I can try to achieve the same results on my end, investigate the cause of the rest of the differences you are seeing, and get back to you with details and feedback. NOTE: When it comes to sharing resources, please know that this is a Q&A Forum thread and anything attached here will be publicly visible to anyone. If you have any concerns about providing confidential data, please feel free to open a separate Support ticket regarding this case so we can continue our conversations there. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. I am looking forward to your reply. Regards, Yoan
