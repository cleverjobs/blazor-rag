# Placeholder Question

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 26 May 2021

I know this was asked before but I cannot find it, however, I have a DatePicker tied to a nullable Datetime. When the datetime is null, the datepicker shows "M/d/yyyy" in the textbox portion of the control. Is there any way I can get rid of than and just show an empty textbox? I am not putting anything in the Format of the DatePicker control so I am guessing that "M/d/yyyy" is the default format but I don't what this to display on the screen. Thanks.

Hello Bob, Here is the request for placeholders on the date pickers: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1452940-placeholder-for-datepicker-and-the-other-date-inputs.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1452940-placeholder-for-datepicker-and-the-other-date-inputs.)
