# How can you "clear all" notifications?

## Question

**Jef** asked on 27 Apr 2021

I do not want to auto close my notifications and just let the user close them manually. But I would like to add a "clear all" button if they have not bothered to clear the notifications for some time. Seems like there should be an easy way to reset the collection but I have not found a way yet.
