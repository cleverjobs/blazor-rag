# Closing a modal Window when submitting a form on a component in the window?

## Question

**Jst** asked on 11 Apr 2023

I have a simple form in a component. The component is in the WindowContent section of the Window component. I would like to close the modal window when the form on the component is saved. How do I go about changing the isVisible property on the page that contains the window?

Resolved by using an event callback to the parent page.
