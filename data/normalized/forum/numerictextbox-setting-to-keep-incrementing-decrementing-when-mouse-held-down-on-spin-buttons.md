# NumericTextBox setting to keep incrementing/decrementing when mouse held down on spin buttons

## Question

**Cir** asked on 13 May 2024

I'm looking at the demo for NumericTextBox, when I hold mouse button the number only increments once. i/ is there any plans for a setting to allow the value to keep incrementing/decrementing when the mouse is held down? This would be more useful in some instances rather than clicking hundreds of times. I know you can type but some users want ability to only use mouse. ii/ related, is there any plans for a setting to control acceleration of how quickly the value increments/decrements based on how long mouse is held for? Eg if mouse is held longer than say 5 seconds then value changes at faster rate.
