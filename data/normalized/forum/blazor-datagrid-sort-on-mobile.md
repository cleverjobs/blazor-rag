# Blazor DataGrid Sort on Mobile

## Question

**송정훈** asked on 27 Apr 2021

Our company is evaluating Telerik's Blazor DataGrid for our project. One thing we would very much like is multi-column sort. What we want to know is whether the function works in a mobile environment(Hybrid App). If it works like a mouse click when touching a column header, we are going to actively consider introducing it.

Hello Song, The grid sorting works with a tap on the header for mobile devices and there are no known issues with that. Hybrid apps are not something we test at this point, but so long as the webview behaves like a proper browser, things should be fine. Regards, Marin Bratanov Progress Telerik
