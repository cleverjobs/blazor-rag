Hi Tito, The UI for Blazor components implement the required WAI-ARIA attributes without the need for any extra configuration which allows one to use them for building accessible web applications. You may check the Accessibility section in our documentation for more details on the matter: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/accessibility/overview.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/accessibility/overview.) I also suggests revising the Accessibility Compliance Components Table - it lists the Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 compliance levels of support for the Blazor UI components. The table also includes links to example demo pages, where you can test the components. I hope you will find the above information and the linked resources useful. Please let us know if any other questions appear. Regards, Nadezhda Tacheva
