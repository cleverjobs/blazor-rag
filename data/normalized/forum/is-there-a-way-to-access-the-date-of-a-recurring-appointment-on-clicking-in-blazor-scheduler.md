# Is there a way to access the date of a recurring appointment on clicking in Blazor scheduler?

## Question

**Mar** asked on 24 Jul 2024

Hi, I've been following this example regarding opening a context menu when right clicking an appointment [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/blob/master/scheduler/appointment-context-menu/](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/blob/master/scheduler/appointment-context-menu/) and I'm wondering if it's possible to access the Date of the specific occurrence that was clicked when using recurring appointments. For example being able to access Mon, 7/22 when right clicking on it to then assigning it to a private variable on the page and such? Best Regards, Marzuk

Hello Marzuk, Currently the Scheduler ItemTemplate context exposes the data item with the recurrence rule, but not occurrence information. We have a feature request to enhance the template and provide the specific occurrence. I voted on your behalf. You can also review the provided workaround - extract the occurrence DateTime from the rendered HTML with JavaScript. Regards, Dimo
