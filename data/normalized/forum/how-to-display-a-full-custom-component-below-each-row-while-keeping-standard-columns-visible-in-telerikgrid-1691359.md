# How to display a full custom component below each row while keeping standard columns visible in TelerikGrid

## Question

**Ken** asked on 25 Jun 2025

Hello, I’m working with the TelerikGrid for Blazor and I have a specific layout need. I would like to display a full custom component (for example, a "MailCard" or a detail panel) under each row of the grid, while still keeping the standard grid columns (like name, date, etc.) visible as usual. I explored the DetailTemplate, which allows me to show custom content per row, but it requires a manual click on the expand (+) button, and I haven't found any official way to auto-expand all rows by default — especially across pages. So my two questions are: Is there a way to embed a full custom component directly within a row, without using the DetailTemplate, while still keeping the columns aligned above? If not, is there a supported method to auto-expand all rows' DetailTemplate by default, even when paging is enabled? Thanks in advance for your help or suggestions. Best regards, Kenzi
