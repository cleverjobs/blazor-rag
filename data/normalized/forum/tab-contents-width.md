# Tab contents width

## Question

**Dav** asked on 19 Mar 2021

I have four tabs in my tab strip, and the content in each tab is of varying width. The tab item resizes to the width of the content as it changes. Is there any way to set a fixed width for all the tabs so they don't expand and contract all the time?

Hi David, As I consider being able to set fixed with to the tabs a very useful feature to control the TabStrip behavior when dealing with content of different sizes, I have created a feature request for it in our public
