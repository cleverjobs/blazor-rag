I have a TelerikGrid and the TelerikLoader is showing when data is OnRead. My rows have detail template, that when you expland the row, I want another Loader window displayed while the detail data is retrieved. I have tried the samples from Telerik but cannot get it to work. Either the Loader does not show at all, OR, I can get it to show and never hide pls halp G
