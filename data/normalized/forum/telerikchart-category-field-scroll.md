# TelerikChart category field scroll

## Question

**HYO** asked on 29 Dec 2021

Hi, Is there any other way I can scroll the category field in the chart other than the stock chart? I would like to show only on month's worth of data beyond scroll to generate a chart with one year's worth of materials. Thank you.

Hello, Currently, only the Stock Chart component provides a navigator and scrolling capabilities. You can vote for exposing a Navigator component for the Chart at: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1547793](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1547793) Apart from using a navigator, the chart can expose its own pan & zoom functionalities, which are partially described in the following request: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1471414](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1471414) Regards, Stamo Gochev
