# export hierarchical grid to pdf

## Question

**Geo** asked on 12 Jul 2024

Hello, We're in need of being able to export a hierarchical grid to pdf within a Blazor WASM. Currently the only example that you are providing is to do a jQuery PDF Export Document Export using jQuery and the Kendo UI for jQuery. Do you have an example that allows us to export to PDF with the UI for Blazor library or another route we can use to get around this issue? Thanks!

Hello George, Currently, the possible options are to integrate the Blazor Grid with: the Kendo UI PDF exporting mechanism, or the Telerik Document Processing PDF generation mechanism. We have a feature request for a built-in Grid export to PDF, which provides relevant details and examples. I see that you have already voted for it. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
