# OpenStreetMap vs Azure Maps

## Question

**Dav** asked on 24 Feb 2024

Hi all; I've just got my first map control up and running (go me!). It is presently running great using the openstreetmap.org data as shown in the examples. It says it can use Azure maps instead. My question is - what advantage do I get from that? And if the advantage is worth it, where do they document how to switch this over to the Azure Maps datasource? thanks - dave

Hi Dave, This is a question that may be best handled by the someone who has actually used both and can provide meaningful insights. I can also recommend online discussions or comparisons such as this one.
