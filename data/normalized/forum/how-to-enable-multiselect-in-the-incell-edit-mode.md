# How to enable multiselect in the InCell edit mode?

## Question

**Myr** asked on 11 Sep 2024

I have a scenario where I want to enable the multiselect for the Telerik Blazor Grid, using the InCell edit mode. This is very important for the scenario I'm working with. I tried to control the selection by my self using a keydown listener in a div that contains the Grid to catch the Control and Shift keys. But, it seems like the Event is not propagated to the div. Thanks!
