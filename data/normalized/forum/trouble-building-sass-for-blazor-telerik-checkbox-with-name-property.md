# Trouble Building SASS for Blazor Telerik Checkbox with Name Property

## Question

**And** asked on 30 Aug 2023

I've been working on a Blazor project and using Telerik components. when I try to set the Name property for the Checkbox. It seems that whenever I include the Name property in the Checkbox, the SASS compilation process fails, throwing an error I'm not familiar with. Has anyone else faced a similar problem

## Answer

Hello Andrea, May I ask you to provide additional information on how you are compiling the themes from the source( e.g what build tools is being used ) ? Also, it would be of great help if you could provide a sample code of the Checkbox that is being used that breaks the application. In this way, I will be able to try and reproduce the exact scenario locally and advise you further. Regards, Dimitar Progress Telerik
