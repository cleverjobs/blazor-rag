# UI for Blazor v 2.70

## Question

**Mar** asked on 03 Feb 2020

It says that is compatible with Blazor WebAssembly 3.2.0 Preview 1. Is it still full compatible Blazor 3.1 -- or in other words if we will not be moving to the 3.2 previews then are we best to stay with a previous version or is it fine to move this latest release? Thanks in advance.

Hi Mark, Yes, it is compatible with the LTS version .NET Core, so you can use it in a server-side project that is something that's in official support phase by MS. You can read more about matching out versions with the framework versions in the following article: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upgrade/framework-versions](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upgrade/framework-versions) Regards, Marin Bratanov
