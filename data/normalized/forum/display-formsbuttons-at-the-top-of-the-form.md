# Display FormsButtons at the Top of the Form

## Question

**bil** asked on 19 Oct 2021

I would like to change the location of the formbuttons. Instead of having them at the bottom of the form, I would like them to be at the top of the form. How can I accomplish this? Regardless of where the <FormButtons> Element is placed, the buttons always display under the form.

I updated the product to "Form" as we are specifically targeting its buttons. You can find the request in our public

Hi Ali, This enhancement is not yet available. The status of the public item is currently "Unplanned" which indicates it is a valid feature that is not yet scheduled for a specific release. The easiest way to follow the progress of the item is to subscribe for it - thus, you will receive notifications when its status is changed. For example, once we schedule its implementation, we will update the item's label and you will be notified accordingly.
