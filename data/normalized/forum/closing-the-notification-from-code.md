# Closing the Notification from code

## Question

**Ale** asked on 24 Feb 2022

My scenario is: When the user starts making changes, I am showing a warning notification to the user to not forget to hit save. After the user presses save, I want to make that notification disappear if it is still visible and the user haven't closed it themselves yet. Please let me know if its possible to do so. Thanks, Alex
