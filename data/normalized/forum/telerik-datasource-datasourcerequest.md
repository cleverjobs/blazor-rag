# Telerik.DataSource DataSourceRequest

## Question

**Sam** asked on 24 Feb 2023

Hi: I want to create a blazor crud using DataSource with entity framework. Do you have a sample code? I found a lot of samples to get data, filter, etc., but not for crud operations using DataSource. Thanks in advance.

Hi Sami, Telerik.DataSource and DataSourceRequest deal with read operations. You don't need them for editing. Our online demos and a Visual Studio project templates show editing scenarios with EntityFramework - see the Grid Data Binding article for links. You can see this similar forum thread about DataSourceRequest and OData, which discusses a similar topic. Regards, Dimo
