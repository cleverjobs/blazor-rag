# TelerikPdfViewer set page from code

## Question

**Dim** asked on 17 Jun 2024

Hey, I'm using the TelerikPdfViewer in blazor to display a PDF, however, I don't want to open the PDF on page 1 , I want to open the PDF to page 5. Is there a way to set the page number from code, I have not found any documentation on setting the page number from code. Kind regards Dimitri
