It currently says 'select files...' If I change the 'Multiple' property to false how do I change the label to 'select file...' for instance? Many thanks Rob

Hello Rob, We have an open feature request for adding a Text/Content parameter for the Upload component button at the following link: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1475229-button-text-content-parameter](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1475229-button-text-content-parameter) I have already added your vote there on your behalf. Votes are important because we use them to track interest. Additionally, you can go and click the "Follow" button to get notified via email over status changes. For the time being, you can consider setting the content through localization. The following demo showcases such an approach. [https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upload/globalization](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/upload/globalization) I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to contact us again. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik

Any news for this question? Why not add an extra property for this component? For example: Caption="Click to upload your files"
