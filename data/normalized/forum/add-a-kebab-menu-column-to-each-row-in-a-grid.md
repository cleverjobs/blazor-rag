# Add a kebab menu column to each row in a grid

## Question

**Kyl** asked on 08 Jan 2025

I'd like to add a kebab menu as the last column for each row in my grid that will show a menu of further actions for that row. I found a sample showing how to do a context menu for each row but can't find anything on how to create a custom column with other controls in it (like the DropDownButton).

Hy Kyle, You can create a custom column and insert whatever you want inside it having the reference to the context of the row. Try checking the following link: Custom Column template I hope this was helpful, Regards
