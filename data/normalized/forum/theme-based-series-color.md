# Theme based series color

## Question

**Bla** asked on 20 Apr 2021

Hello. I got three charts and I want to apply the primary, secondary and tertiary colors of the selected theme respectively. It's a silly question but I didn't figure it out. I've tried setting the Color property of the series to ThemeColors.Secondary or adding differents combinations of styles to the chart. Nothing worked properly. The only way at the moment is to set the color (rgb, hexa, etc) manually in the Color property of the series. Since the theme can be changed at runtime, I would like to use the theme colors and not have them fixed. Any suggestion? By the way, if a don't set the color property it gets the ThemeColors.Primary value... unfortunatelly all charts will have the same color and trying to avoid it. Regards, Brazorist.
