Hi Martin HerlÃ¸v, Thank you for reaching out! You are correct, there seems to be a problem with the button layout in the popup edit form. While researching this matter, I found out this regression occurs as of version 4.3.0 of UI for Blazor - prior to that the buttons appear in the correct layout. Great catch! I logged a bug report for that on your behalf: Popup Edit Form: Buttons do not render in the correct layout as of version 4.3.0 I added your vote there but we are generally striving to fix the regressions as quickly as possible. As a creator, you will get an email notification when the status of the item changes. For the time being, possible workarounds are to position the buttons with CSS or use a Popup Buttons Template. Last but not least, I want to take a moment to thank you for pointing our attention to that behavior! As a small token of gratitude, I have rewarded your account with some Telerik points.
