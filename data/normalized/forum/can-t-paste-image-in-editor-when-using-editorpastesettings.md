# Can't paste image in Editor when using EditorPasteSettings

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 12 May 2021

I am using the editorpastesettings: <EditorSettings> <EditorPasteSettings ConvertMsLists="true" RemoveMsClasses="true" RemoveMsStyles="true" RemoveHtmlComments="true"> </EditorPasteSettings> </EditorSettings> However, when I use these settings it is preventing me from pasting an image (not from a word document, just a screen grab) into the editor. If I take out the EditorSettings, it works fine. I'm not sure why any of these settings would (or should) prevent me from pasting an image into the editor?
