# autogenerate columns with datatable

## Question

**Ber** asked on 27 Sep 2020

Hi, I'm retrieving data using a select query into a datatable. When I try to show this data in a grid with the AutoGenerateColumns=true, the data is not shown. Is there a way to show the data from a datatable in a grid with automatic generation of the columns? The number of columns in the query are dynamic, before execution of the query I don't know the number of columns. Thanks

Hello Bert, You can loop over the columns collection of the data table to generate the columns in a foreach loop, in a fashion very similar to this example for expando objects: [https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/blob/master/grid/binding-to-expando-object/BindingToExpandoObject/Pages/AutoGeneratedColumns.razor.](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/blob/master/grid/binding-to-expando-object/BindingToExpandoObject/Pages/AutoGeneratedColumns.razor.) I would suggest you also consider a collection of expnado objects as the grid data source as it offers better built-in integration - it does not require that you alter the data into a collection of dictionaries through the OnRead event.
