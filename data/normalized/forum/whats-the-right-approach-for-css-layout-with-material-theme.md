# Whats the right approach for CSS layout with Material theme ?

## Question

**Mat** asked on 18 Nov 2021

Hi I am writing a complex front end application using the Telerik Blazor web controls with Material theme. Layout with the inbuilt Telerik components wont work for us - we need a fully featured CSS layout library (which is what our designers use) Which CSS layout lib do you recommend with Material theme ? Would bootstrap with a material theme and Telerik components with material layout work together ? Thanks, Matt
