Hi Team, For nested folders with the same name, clicking on any folder redirects to the main folder with the same name FileManager For eg.: I have folder path: "C:AppName/Storage /FileStorage/Test/Test/Test/Test/Test/Test" Now if I click on second last folder with name "Test" from breadcrumb, it redirects to the first folder with name "Test". Can you help me with this?
