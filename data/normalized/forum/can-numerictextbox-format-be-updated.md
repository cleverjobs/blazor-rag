# Can NumericTextBox Format Be Updated?

## Question

**Tim** asked on 12 Apr 2021

Can NumericTextBox Format Be Updatedat run time? In other words, if numerictextbox is being used for dimensions and the user changes the preferred dimensional unit from "centimeters" to "inches" can the Format be changed from "0.## cm" to "0.## in" at runtime? If so, are there any examples of it? Thanks, Tim
