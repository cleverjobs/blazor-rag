# Clearing Timepicker leaves "AM" and borders control in red

## Question

**Chr** asked on 19 Oct 2023

When clearing a nullable DateTime-bound TimePicker control (by highlighting the value and hitting delete), why does the control leave the "AM" and also border itself in red? Is there a way configure the TimePicker control so it doesn't do this?

Hi Chris, I confirm that we already have an open bug report regarding the described problem with nullable DateTime bound: DatePicker, TimePicker and DateTimePicker should accept null value as valid when bound to nullable DateTime. You can vote there to raise the priority of this issue. By subscribing to the bug report, you will receive email notifications for any updates on its status. I am sorry for any inconvenience the issue may have caused you. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
