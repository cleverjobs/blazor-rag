# Force sort to just alternate between ascending and descending?

## Question

**Jas** asked on 24 Feb 2022

Is there a way for sort to just alternate between ascending and descending? Currently if you keep clicking, it has a 3rd state of no sort which is never a state we want. If the answer is use OnStateChange, I can just do that then.

## Answer

Hello Jason, As you correctly said, it is possible to achieve such functionality with the OnStateChanged or OnRead events. There is a feature request to Allow Unsort for the Grid. You can check the REPL workaround example in the thread. I suggest to follow and vote for the request, as we prioritize future development on customer demand. Regards, Apostolos Progress Telerik
