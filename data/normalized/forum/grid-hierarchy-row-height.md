# Grid Hierarchy row height

## Question

**Mar** asked on 30 Jan 2025

Hy, On my page I have a hierarchical grid so I can display additional data for each row: As you can see the height of each line takes up a lot of unnecessary space and only when I resize the screen the height of the line decreases: Is there a way to set the minimum height by default? I think the problem is the '+' and '-' icons Thanks for help, Marco
