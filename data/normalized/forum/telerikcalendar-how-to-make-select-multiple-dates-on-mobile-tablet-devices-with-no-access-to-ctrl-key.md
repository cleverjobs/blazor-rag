# TelerikCalendar: how to make select multiple dates on mobile/tablet devices, with no access to CTRL key

## Question

**KanKan** asked on 23 May 2023

Hi, I am using TelerikCalendar Blazor component and set its SelectionMode="@CalendarSelectionMode.Multiple". It works fine on computer as there is CTRL key to hold and click multiple dates to select them. My question is how to make multi-selection on mobile/touch screen devices. There is no CTRL key. How does TelerikCalendar support mult-selection on those devices? Thanks Kan

Additionally, I noticed the CTRL key is not only for select multiple dates, but also used for de-selecting dates. How to do that (multi-selection and de-select dates) on mobile/touch screen devices without CTRL key? Thanks
