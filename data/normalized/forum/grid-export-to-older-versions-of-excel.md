# Grid export to older versions of Excel

## Question

**Dou** asked on 28 Oct 2020

I have a Telerik grid with the export to excel function enabled and it works fine for most users, however some users have old versions of Excel and for them the date columns are displaying a bogus date or no date at all. Is this a known issue or is there a workaround?

Hi Doug, Could you check the following thread and see if this will answer your questions: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1492859-use-dd-mm-yy-format-for-datetime-in-excel-export?](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1492859-use-dd-mm-yy-format-for-datetime-in-excel-export?) I've added your vote to it to raise its priority because I think that using a "default" format should solve this as long as the client an read xlsx files. I've also added your Vote for its predecessor - a custom formats feature. Regards, Marin Bratanov
