# TimePicker Blazor custom header text

## Question

**Juk** asked on 28 Sep 2023

Hello, I see there is no way to set TimePicker header in the modal of Telerik UI for Blazor component. The default implementation is not very usable in many situations and I would really like to have my own text and logic there. Is it possible to add it there somehow or how should I proceed?

Hi Jukka, We have an open feature request that will allow you to achieve the desired customizations in the TimePicker component: A Template that controls the rendering of the TimePicker. You can vote for it to raise the item's priority and subscribe to it to receive email notifications for status updates. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
