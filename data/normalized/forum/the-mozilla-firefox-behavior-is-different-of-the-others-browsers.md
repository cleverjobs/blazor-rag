# The Mozilla Firefox behavior is different of the others browsers

## Question

**Yan** asked on 15 Feb 2024

Hi. I'm facing a embarassing problem about browser compatibility of DataGrid. I want to load my data on demand when the user scroll. For that i have choosed a DataGrid and i have implemented a behavior like a "scroll infini" which authorize the user to moove his scrollbar anywhere in the grid. Everything work but ... on Mozilla Firefox, the Grid work like a incremential grid and not a infinite scroll grid. Even if the code is exactly the same. On this first screenshot you can see the scrollbar of the grid with Mozilla Firefox (which reduce when you scroll). On the second one screenshot, I am on Microsoft Edge (on the same page and same URL) but there the behavior is correct (the scroll bar is small and i can move it anywhere i want even if the data is not yet loaded). The DataGrid work well with browser that use Chromium kernel (Microsoft Edge, Opera and Chromium for example). Do you have any idea ? Thanks. Best regards, Yanis.
