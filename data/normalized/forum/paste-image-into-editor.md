# Paste Image into Editor?

## Question

**BobBob** asked on 18 Sep 2020

I am coming from the Kendo Editor and in that editor I had the ability to paste an image into the editor and it would add it to markup as a base64 string. It does not appear that the Blazor editor is allowing this as nothing happens when I try to paste an image into it. I don't want to use the "insert image" button in the editor as I don't want the user to have to save the image somewhere and "link it". We want our users to be able to take a screen shot of something and just paste it into the editor. Is there any way this can be accomplished?
