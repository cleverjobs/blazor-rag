# Can you set the title of the grid hierarchy column that is auto-generated through the DetailTemplate?

## Question

**Ant** asked on 29 May 2024

Like the title says, I am using a grid hierarchy and would like to set the title of the grid hierarchy column to say "Details" rather than it just be an empty column title. This is the column that contains the expand/collapse icons.
