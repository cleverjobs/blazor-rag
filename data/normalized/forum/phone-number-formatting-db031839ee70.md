# Phone Number Formatting

## Question

**Sco** asked on 06 Oct 2020

What's the best way to add a textbox in Blazor with phone number formatting? For example the data is 1112223333 but you want it to appear as (111) 222-3333.

Hi Scott, This will be something you can do with the upcoming Masked Textbox component: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1433593-masked-input-textbox](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1433593-masked-input-textbox) Regards, Marin Bratanov
