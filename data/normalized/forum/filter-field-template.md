Hi Jeremy, A FilterField template is a great idea for a new feature in the Filter component. I opened a feature request on your behalf on our Public Feedback Portal: Filter Field Template This new template will allow you to achieve the desired result. I voted on your behalf and raised the priority of the public item. You are also automatically subscribed to receive email notifications for status updates. If there is anything else we can help with, I would be glad. Thank you. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
