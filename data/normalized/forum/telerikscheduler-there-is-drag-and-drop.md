# TelerikScheduler there is drag and drop

## Question

**n/an/a** asked on 09 Feb 2022

Hi, everyone, I have the following problem: Telerik UI for Blazor version 2.30 I want to drag and drop an item from a TelerikTreeListView onto a TelerikScheduler. However, TelerikScheduler does not offer the required events. Is there a workaround for this or is it not possible at all?

Hi Mike, You can Follow the implementation of drag and drop functionality for the scheduler here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1456642-drag-drop-events.](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1456642-drag-drop-events.) At this point I can't say exactly what form it will take, though, that would be known after the appropriate research and implementation are done. Regards, Marin Bratanov
