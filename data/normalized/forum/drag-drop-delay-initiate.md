# Drag & Drop delay initiate

## Question

**And** asked on 03 May 2022

In my treeview the user can double-click to open an item or they can drag to reorganize the tree. When you double-click you can see the drag & drop initiates for the brief fraction of a second. Which is a confusing and unpleasant UX. It would be preferable if a drag & drop didn't initiate until the user dragged for 3-4 pixels from the mousedown location, as opposed to a single pixel. In general if there's a behavior like this that I would want to tweak, are there ways to adjust the control or override behaviors using Javascript? I used to do all sorts of stuff with the jQuery controls. Thanks, -Andy
