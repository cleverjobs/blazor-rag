Is there a way to change the Vertical Axis labels in a Chart column graph to only show whole numbers instead of fractional numbers?

Hi, By default, the chart finds the min and max values in the data set and adds a little to them to show all the data. This means that without additional settings, only the data determines the scale of the axis. So, what you can do is to set the Min and Max of the axis to ensure they match whole numbers together with the step. Regards, Marin Bratanov
