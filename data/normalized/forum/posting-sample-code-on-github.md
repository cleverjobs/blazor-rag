# Posting sample code on GitHub

## Question

**Dav** asked on 24 Aug 2023

I have a sample C# Blazor app that uses the Telerik Map component. I have used the full license. What changes, if any, do I need to make to my code if it is to be published publically on GitHub. assuming users would in the main just install the 30 day trial of Telerik UI for Blazor. I have, in my instructions indicated they only need do steps 0, 2 and 4 at First Steps with Server-Side UI for Blazor.

Hello David, There are several aspects to this question. Please direct your attention to our license agreement and specifically (but not limited to) - article 1.2.5. Limitations on Evaluation or Trial Licenses article 1.2.6. Redistribution section 4.A.2. Redistribution under Developer License definition 3.1.3. “Permitted End User” definition 3.1.5. “Your Integrated Product” section 3.5. Trial License Generally, our policies prohibit us from interpreting our license agreement in simple terms or confirming compliance. This is because we don't have all the context and also, we may rephrase the legal language incorrectly. So I am sorry I can't be detailed here. My recommendation is to consult a legal advisor if you are in doubt. In any case, I have reservations about the compliance of the described use case, for example - An app source code in GitHub does not represent an "integrated product". A public repository cannot guarantee defined "permitted end users". Our trial license is intended only for the purpose of product evaluation prior to purchase. A trial may not be used as temporary workaround to access and use our product. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik

Hello David, If "offline" means "by phone", then you can use the phone numbers on our Contacts page. You will reach our customer advocates. Otherwise, if you just need a non-public channel to us, then you have two other options: Renew your commercial license and use a technical support ticket or the technical phone assistance line. In this case you will get in touch with a technical support engineer. Submit a non-technical support ticket from this page. In this case, you will get in touch with a customer advocate. No matter what you select, I recommend you to refer to this forum thread for context. On a side note, let me reiterate that we must not provide legal consulting for license compliance. I am mentioning this again to make sure we are on the same page.
