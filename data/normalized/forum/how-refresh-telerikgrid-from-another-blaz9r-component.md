Hi Jose, I confirm that it is indeed possible to manually force a refresh on the Grid component. There are multiple methods available to achieve this. To assist you further, I recommend referring to an article in our documentation titled " Grid - Refresh Data. " It provides clear examples and guidance on these different methods. If you encounter any difficulties while implementing any of the aforementioned approaches, I remain available to assist further. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
