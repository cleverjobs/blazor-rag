I see from the demo on how to show a context menu on right click of its container, but how do I have it display on click (left click)?

Hello Kelly, You can use the ShowAsync method of the context menu to show it at the desired location based on your own events and business logic (such as left click events). You can find more details and examples here: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/contextmenu/integration](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/contextmenu/integration) Regards, Marin Bratanov
