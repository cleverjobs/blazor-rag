# Gantt disable move next row on enter

## Question

**Mat** asked on 11 Dec 2023

Is it possible to disable the movement to the next row when a user uses the enter key to edit a field with in-cell editing? I looked through the forums but only found an old thread regarding a WinForms property for an EnterKeyMode. This would be a great addition to the Blazor controls.

Hi Matt, A feature request that will allow you to customize the "Enter" key behavior has already been submitted to our Public Feedback Portal: Add the ability to customize the keyboard shortcuts. You can vote there and raise the priority of the item. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
