**Emi** asked on 08 Oct 2021

Hello, Is there a way to offset the data shown on the axis, without removing any data. The issue is show below, where the text overlap, and my question is then if there is a posibility to offset the text as shown in the last image. Or maybe something simular. Best Regards, Emil

Hello Emil, The following article shows how you can do several things: rotate the labels so they don't overlap render only every n-th label so you can choose the approach best suited to your case. link: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/chart-crowded-labels](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/chart-crowded-labels) Regards, Marin Bratanov
