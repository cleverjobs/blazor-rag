# Gantt Chart - item baseline start and end

## Question

**haP** asked on 16 Dec 2022

Hi Good native Gantt component - really pleased you have implemented most useful functions. One that I use a lot is a baseline start and end date for activities - to visually see how delay or variation has occurred over time (se attached image for basic example) Is there a way to do this at the moment? if not is this something you could think of adding?
