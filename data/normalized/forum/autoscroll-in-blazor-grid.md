# Autoscroll in Blazor Grid

## Question

**Cha** asked on 28 Jul 2022

Hi, Is it possible to automatically vertically scroll the rows in a Telerik blazor grid like they do in the flight information display systems at the airports? Can you please point me to some samples or tell me the best approach? Thanks, Abhi
