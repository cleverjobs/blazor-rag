Could you please add Case Control for text formatting s o that I can quickly change selected text casing in bulk with the click of a button or keyboard shortcut. As example here: The “Change Case” function must include the following options: Sentence case lowercase UPPERCASE Capitalize Each Word tOGGLE cASE Thank you so much Telerik team. I believe you are the best. And I hope you could apply Case Control.
