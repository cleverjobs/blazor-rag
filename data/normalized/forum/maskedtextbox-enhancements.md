# MaskedTextBox enhancements

## Question

**Bla** asked on 04 May 2022

I was thinking of using the MaskedText component to provide the user with more information on how to complete a form and also to validate the values entered along with regular expressions in annotations. The component works well when the format of the mask is inflexible but unfortunately most of the values that are entered in a form are not. It works but it's not very useful. My question is the following: is there a way to have rules that make the format of the mask more flexible (without falling in js)? The full set of alternatives that regular expressions have may be too much, but at least a subset would be convenient. Do you plan to extend the rules to be more flexible? Greetings. Ludwig.

Not to be offensive here, but you are essentially asking them to modify their component (" Do you plan to extend the rules to be more flexible?"), yet you have not provided any steps to reproduce, no any concrete examples.

Yes, basically the question is whether or not they have in mind to extend the mask rules. I think the point is sufficiently explained and there are no steps to be reproduced, but as an example I am thinking of the mask for a MAC Address or any hexadecimal value or an IP address.
