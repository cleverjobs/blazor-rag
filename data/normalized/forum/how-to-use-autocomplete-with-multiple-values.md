# How to use AutoComplete with multiple values?

## Question

**Ale** asked on 27 Feb 2022

The user wants to enter several values separated by a comma, but with AutoComplete, when the user selects a value, it always clears the previous values. Is it possible to have an Append behavior, where the value gets appended rather than the current Overwrite behavior? What I want to do is actually almost the same as the Tags textbox I used now to create this post. Thanks! Edit: Never mind, I think Multiselect is what I should use.
