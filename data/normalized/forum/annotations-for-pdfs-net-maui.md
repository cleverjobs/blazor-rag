# Annotations for PDFs .NET MAUI

## Question

**JonJon** asked on 01 Jul 2023

Nice job on R2 2023 release! I like the PDF Viewer UI Controls. Question: Any plans to add ANNOTATIONS and COMMENTS to client-side .NET Blazor MAUI libraries such as this serverside solution? In fact, I would even be willing to contribute to this development to be part of the Telerik offerings.

Hello Jon, Thank you for your feedback about the PDF Viewer for .NET MAUI. Regarding to the annotations and comments, we do not have such option. I have logged this as a feature request here: [https://feedback.telerik.com/maui/1614785-pdf-viewer-implement-comment-text-annotations](https://feedback.telerik.com/maui/1614785-pdf-viewer-implement-comment-text-annotations) Regarding to the source code, we do not provide the source code for Telerik MAUI controls. Regards, Didi Progress Telerik

Thank you. Just to clarify, I am willing to contribute i.e. pay for this feature to Telerik or any third party. You own it. I just want to use it. No source code needed. With kind regards, Jon

Hi Jon, Before we continue reviewing this request, could you please elaborate more on the following: The feature request is logged for Telerik UI for .NET MAUI PDF Viewer control as you have submitted your question in Telerik UI for .NET MAUI forum Page. The request is valid for PDF Viewer for .NET MAUI. The control is used in a .NET MAUI applications. As you have mentioned .NET MAUI Blazor, Could you please specify whether you want this functionality in Telerik UI for Blazor PDF viewer control? I have noticed you logged the same request for PDF Viewer for Blazor: [https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1584409-pdf-annotations-for-client-side](https://feedback.telerik.com/blazor/1584409-pdf-annotations-for-client-side) Also what other annotations you want to add in the PDF Viewer for .NET MAUI?

Thank you for the question and sorry for any confusion. Basically, I would like in the PDF Viewer to include i) PDF annotations and ii) PDF forms offered in .NET MAUI BLAZOR (and hybrid if possible). The solution should not require an active connection to the server. I am willing to pay Telerik (or any independent developer) to have developed in your PDF viewer control to provide an extensible model where the toolbar can be modified and using the toolkit, these functionalities can be exposed. Here is an example but not in .NET MAUI BLAZOR - Blazor PDF Viewer Form Filling Example - Syncfusion Demos Does this clarify? Thank you Jon

Hi Jon, Could tyou please specify what kind of annotations are requred? If you can send us some images. Also from the provided details, it seems you want this functionality for Telerik UI for Blazor PDF Viewer, not in the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI PDF Viewer? Is this correct? Blazor and .NET MAUI are differnet frameworks and Telerik UI for Blazor controls are different from Telerik UI for .NET MAUI controls. Please share which technology and controls you use.

I work with Jon and we are asking for a Blazor PDF Viewer control, web assembly version that can completely run in the client side without requiring connectivity with the server and supports following functionality: 1. User can add annotations in the pdf file 2. Custom toolbar 3. User is able to fill pdf forms

@Mir - Currently the Blazor PDF Viewer supports custom tools in its toolbar. With regard to annotations (point 1 and 3), this is still a feature request. You can vote and follow it for future updates.
