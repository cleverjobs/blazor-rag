# GridLayout: Chnage VerticalAlign for a single Cell

## Question

**Hen** asked on 13 May 2023

I love the GridLayout-Component. I use it a lot. I mostly set the Grid Parameter " VerticalAlign" to Center. But that is for all the Cells in the Grid. But sometimes I want to set the Alignment of just one Cell to e.g. "Top". How is that possible ? It would be a great feature having this Property for each GridItem...

Hi Hendrik, Set a Class to the GridLayoutItem and use it to apply an align-self style. REPL example Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
