Hello VIshnu, This is already available through the HasChildren field, you can see more in the documentation: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/treeview/data-binding/overview.](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/treeview/data-binding/overview.) You can also check the examples from the adjacent articles that show expected behavior so you can compare against them. Regards, Marin Bratanov
