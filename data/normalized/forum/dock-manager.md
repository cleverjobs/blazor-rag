Hello Vegar, The initial plan was to introduce the docking component in late 2024. However, the current state of our product development and strategy makes this outcome less likely, so we will probably postpone it to early 2025. Please follow the public Docking Manager item for status updates. This is the official source of truth. Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
