## Question

**Hen** asked on 19 Apr 2023

Like I mentioned in the subject a needs an Excel-Export that exports only the selected items/rows. I found this article: Excel-Export and it works fine. But it works only with the build in GridCommandButton. I need a programmatic Export like described in article Programmatic Export Any help ?
