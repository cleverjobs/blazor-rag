Hello Luis, I have tried to reproduce the issue in a REPL example using the latest version of the Telerik UI as well as version 4.0.0, but I was not able to replicate it. Could you please provide more information about the implementation or steps to reproduce the problem? Alternatively, it would be very helpful if you could modify the REPL example I'm sending you so that the issue is reproducible. This will allow us to examine the issue more closely and we can try to find a possible solution. In addition, could you please let me know which version of the package you are currently using? We have had similar issues in older versions, so it would be helpful to know which version you are using. If you are using an older version, can you please try upgrading? This will help us to confirm if the problem still occurs in the latest version. Thank you for your cooperation in advance.
