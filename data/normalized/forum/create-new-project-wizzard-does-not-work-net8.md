Hello Djordje, Currently we are analyzing the business value and technical value of our project templates, and what should they include. From this point of view, current development of new project templates is on hold. This is an excellent opportunity to ask you for some more information: How often do you use Telerik Blazor project templates. What is the main reason for you to use Telerik Blazor project templates: You use them as a learning resource. In this case, please explain in what way the project templates are better than the runnable documentation examples or the complete sample apps that we link from our demo site home page? You use them as a quick option to create an app with our components inside. In this case, please explain what components you need inside the project template and why. Do you need any other features of our project templates, which don't exist yet? Do you use our scaffolders or snippets? Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik

I am the new owner of the Telerik license so I am in the discovery stage with this tool. Main
reason to use Telerik Blazor was information that I found on the internet.
It was considered as the most complete Blazor template even ChatGPT
recommended. The rest of your question considers more elaboration so if
you are really interested to learn what one very experienced developer
could say then feel free to send me an email.
