Sure, why not? See Grid With Sortable="true" and FilterMode="Telerik.Blazor.GridFilterMode.FilterMenu"

Before I had FilterMode="Telerik.Blazor.GridFilterMode.FilterRow" and Sortable="true" together but after change on FilterMenu, filter disappear.

I'm not sure what you mean by "filter disappear". Does the example help? Can you modify the sample I gave that makes the "filter disappear"?

I'm sorry, but on version 2.30.0 it doesn't work. I tried it on 3.4.0 and there it works.
