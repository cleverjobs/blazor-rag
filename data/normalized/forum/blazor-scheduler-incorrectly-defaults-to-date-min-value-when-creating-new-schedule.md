# Blazor Scheduler incorrectly defaults to date min value when creating new schedule

## Question

**MacMac** asked on 18 Mar 2024

I'm trying to figure out why when creating a new appointment in the blazor scheduler the popup window has start and end dates as min values instead of the date/time relating to the user click - is this a known issue? Try creating a new appointment here and look at the dates in the popup here - Blazor Scheduler (Event Calendar) Demos - Overview | Telerik UI for Blazor - am I missing something, this can't be by design..?

Hi Mac, A bug report for the described behavior has already been submitted on our public feedback portal: When creating an appointment Start and End editors display the default DateTime value. Its fix is already scheduled for around May (Q2 this year). You can also subscribe to the item to receive email notifications for status updates. Regards, Hristian Stefanov Progress Telerik
