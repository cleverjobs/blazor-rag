I just started learning Blazor and I hit a speed bump right out of the gate. I am trying to come up to speed on Blazor. I am following a tutorial on youtube. The tutorial has this image. But when I am working with Visual Studio 2024 Community Version, I have this: It is because things are completely different with Visual Studio Code? Please advise.

Hi William, The newest versions of dotnet have changed the Blazor templates to use the "Blazor Web App" format, Ed Charbeneau released a post to help understand this. The older template format is still compatible with the latest versions. If you would like to follow the tutorial closely, I think you could create a new Blazor project and avoid using the Web App template.
