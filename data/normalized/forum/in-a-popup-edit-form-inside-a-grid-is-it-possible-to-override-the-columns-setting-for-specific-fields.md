## Question

In a popup edit form inside a grid is it possible to override the columns setting for specific fields? I have set up a grid popup edit form with 4 columns. One of the fields is too big for 1 column and I would like to have it display over 2 columns. Is there a method like ColSpan for a popup edit form? Or is there a way to make it work?
