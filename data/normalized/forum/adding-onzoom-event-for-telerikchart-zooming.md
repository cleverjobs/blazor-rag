# Adding OnZoom event for TelerikChart Zooming

## Question

**GalGal** asked on 14 Feb 2025

Hey, I am working on a Telerik for Blazor UI project and I'm really liking alll the Telerik features so far. However, when there are too many data points on my graph, the x axis becomes really hard to read, so I added a feature to scale the number of visible x-axis categories based on the number of intervals. For this purpose, I was hoping to add a feature so that when one zooms into the graph, more of the x-axis intervals become visible based on how many can comfortably fit on screen. To this end, I need to know how much a user has zoomed in so that I can scale things accordingly. However, from all I can find online, there is no way to query a TelerikChart for how zoomed in you are. I might be missing something, but in case I am not, I think this feature could be very helpful so that one can add events based on the zoom in and have things change accordingly. Thanks
