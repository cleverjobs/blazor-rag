Hi Ilan, The Telerik UI Map supports everything that OpenStreetMap supports as well as any GeoJSON. Google maps is an application of its own that exceeds the functionality of any UI standalone component. We currently do not have support for Google maps. I can recommend using the default Google maps application directly in your app. Regards, Tsvetomir
