# DropDown with Grid

## Question

**Vol** asked on 01 Apr 2024

Hello, i ́m evaluating Telerik UI for Blazor. Maybe you can help me: it is possible to bind a WebGrid IgbGrid to a Web-DropDown with full
Grid-FUncrtionality like sorting, grouping, filtering? Attached you find a
sample of the Use-Case.

Hi Volkhard, I am not familiar with the WebGrid IgbGrid and the Web-DropDown, so I would appreciate it if you can help me better understand the scenario. This will allow me to evaluate and suggest the most optimal solution with the UI for Blazor components. Generally speaking, it is possible to include a Telerik DropDownList in a Grid column. However, I am trying to understand what is the purpose of the DropDown in the “Nickname” column. What currently concerns me is that when opening the DropDown, the same grid is displayed in the popup. Can you please elaborate more on the use case? Thank you in advance! I look forward to hearing from you!
