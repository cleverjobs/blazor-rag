# GridSearchBox show clear button

## Question

**Ron** asked on 17 Apr 2025

Hello, how can I make the clear-value button in the GridSearchBox always visible? By default, the clear button only appears when the GridSearchBox has a value. I’d like it to always be visible, even when the input is empty. Thanks

You can't make the clear button always visible in the GridSearchBox, nor in similar components like TelerikTextBox. The button only appears and can be clicked when there’s a value entered in the input. If you really need this behavior, you’d have to implement it yourself using a raw HTML input element. Honestly, I don’t think it’s worth the effort. Regards, Anislav Atanasov
