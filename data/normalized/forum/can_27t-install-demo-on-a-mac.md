# Can't install demo on a Mac

## Question

**TimTim** asked on 28 Dec 2019

How do I install the Demo version on MacOS (Mojave)? When I try to download, I only have the option of an exe or an msi - neither of which open on the Mac.

It's ok. I figured out where the downloads page was and downloaded the zip. [https://www.telerik.com/account/my-downloads](https://www.telerik.com/account/my-downloads) As you were.

Hi Tim, Indeed, the zip archive is the way to go for non-Windows machines. For anyone else having a hard time finding it, here's an article that describes how to get it: [https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/installation/zip](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/installation/zip) Regards, Marin Bratanov
