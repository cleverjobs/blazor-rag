# Expand TreeView programmatically doesn't seam to work

## Question

**Cip** asked on 09 Dec 2020

Hi everyone, By setting the property Expanded equal to true in the collection the treeview does not expand anymore. This was working before but now, it doesn't. To explain you more precisely what I have done: in the model I have the property Expanded. On double click on the node (not on the arrow in front of the node) I'am am setting the Expanded property to true if the node is closed or if the node is opened I'm setting the Expanded property to false. This was working before, but now it doesn't. Have you changed something for this component? How can I fix this issue? Can you help me please? Best regards, Cipri
