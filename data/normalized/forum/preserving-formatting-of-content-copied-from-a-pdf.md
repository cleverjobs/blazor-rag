## Question

**Ric** asked on 12 Jul 2024

I want to preserve new lines upon pasting content in the TelerikEditor component, which had been copied from a PDF file. Example: Copying this snippet from the pdf and pasting it onto the TelerikEditor results in: 1. Previous case law and legal principles 2. Statutes 3. Society's values 4. Customs and Course of dealings Is it possible to preserve formatting of content copied from a PDF?
