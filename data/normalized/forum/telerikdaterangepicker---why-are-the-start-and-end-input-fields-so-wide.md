# TelerikDateRangePicker - why are the start and end input fields so wide?

## Question

**Mar** asked on 08 Jul 2021

Even on the demo page, the start and end date fields are way too wide. I figured they only need to be around 110px for my needs, but I don't see a way to control the width of those.

Hi Mark, By design, the inputs we have have a certain width. This is to provide consistent display and to fit data. For example, other people may choose different formats that are longer (like using words for the month names). That said, you can use CSS to change the width of the inputs.
