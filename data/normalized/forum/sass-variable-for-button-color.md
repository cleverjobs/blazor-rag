## Question

**Twa** asked on 29 May 2024

Hello. I have changed almost all the variables in the theme builder but I have not been successful so I ask: what is the Sass variable to change the color of the buttons of the components in the ThemeBuilder?

Hi Twain, The SASS variables for the Button's text color and background color are $kendo-button-text and $kendo-button-bg These variables depend on the values of variables on-base and base. In the ThemeBuilder UI, these are $on-base and $base. You can find more information about the theme variables in our Progress Design System documentation: Default theme variables Customize the Default theme Colors overview Regards, Dimo Progress Telerik
