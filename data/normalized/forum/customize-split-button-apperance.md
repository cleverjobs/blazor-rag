# Customize Split Button Apperance

## Question

**Iva** asked on 10 Jan 2023

Hello! CSS geniuses please help... The TelerikSplitButton and TelerikButtonGroup components are just made for each other to put together convenient interfaces, but you need a little help with setting them up. For a perfect display, I need to remove the border, a big right margin and set a transparent background. But I can't get to the classes in dev tools - the container hides as soon as you try to read the DOM. Can you please tell me which class properties should be overridden?
