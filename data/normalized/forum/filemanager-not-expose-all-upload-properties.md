# FileManager not expose all Upload properties

## Question

**And** asked on 17 Jun 2024

In the documentation ( link ) is written that "Configure the integrated Upload through the FileManagerUploadSettings child tag of FileManagerSettings. The FileManager exposes parameter names that are identical to the respective Upload component API members ", but the FileManagerUploadSettings expose only a subset of upload properties. This is a very limitation because we can't customize the upload or support the upload of multiple file. I think the documentation needs to be correct, or what I would prefer, that all the properties be correctly exposed by FileManagerUploadSettings. thanks -- Andrea

Hi Andrea, We have a feature request for multiple file uploads in the FileManager and I voted for it on your behalf. Please let me know what else do you need, which is currently missing?
