## Description

Sometimes user actions can be sensitive or result in data deletion. For such cases, you may want to require confirmation to protect against accidental clicks.

## Solution

UI for Blazor includes [Alert, Confirm and Prompt popup dialogs](slug:dialog-predefined), which can be used to interact with the user.

Another option is to use the [Window component](slug:window-overview), if the predefined Dialogs do not provide enough flexibility for a specific scenario. Here are two examples:
