#one-instance-per-app-link

You can declare a single notification instance in the main layout of your app and pass it down to all components in the app so they can all show notifications if they need to. You can find an example implementation in the [One Notification Instance for All Components](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/notification/single-instance-per-app) sample project.
